fix: `lowdefy dev` works with `config.basePath`, dev warns about inline page links, and the agent docs are complete

- `lowdefy dev` now boots an app that sets `config.basePath`. The dev server used to answer `<basePath>/@vite/client` and the client entry with the page HTML, so the app never loaded. The app, its API and the `/lowdefy-docs` agent tools are all served under the base path (`/app/lowdefy-docs` for `basePath: /app`), and `.lowdefy/instance.json` records the URL with the base path, so `lowdefy mcp`, the hub and `lowdefy test` reach the dev server without extra setup. The dev server also reports itself ready and opens the browser at the base path.
- `lowdefy dev` now reports the same warnings as `lowdefy build` for pages written directly in `lowdefy.yaml`: a `Link` to a page that does not exist, a `CallAPI` to a missing or `InternalApi` endpoint, websocket and dynamic block references, and `_state`, `_payload` and request state references. Before, only pages in their own `_ref` files were checked in dev.
- `@lowdefy/docs-content` holds 20 pages it was missing, among them theming, blocks, page and app state, roles, auth configuration, websockets and notifications. The extractor now renders docs pages written as `_nunjucks` templates, and the content is regenerated from the current docs. The docs site's notifications, AxiosHttp and v3-to-v4 migration pages now show their `{{ ... }}` template examples instead of dropping them; the notifications page failed to render before.
