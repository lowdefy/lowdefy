feat(blocks-aggrid): Add `AgGridLowdefy`, upgrade to AG Grid v33, and theme every grid through the Theming API.

**Two new blocks.** `AgGridLowdefy` (display) and `AgGridLowdefyInput` (input) are grids themed from the app's antd design tokens — primary colour, surfaces, fonts and radius — so they look like they belong in a Lowdefy app and follow light/dark mode automatically, with no configuration and no separate dark block. They take a `size` property (`small | middle | large`, default `middle`) mirroring antd Table's densities, which sets row and header height to 36 / 44 / 54 pixels. Everything else — properties, events, methods, cell renderers — is identical to the existing grids.

To adopt, change `type: AgGridBalham` to `type: AgGridLowdefy` (or `type: AgGridInputBalham` to `type: AgGridLowdefyInput`). Every property carries over unchanged and the grid will deliberately look different afterwards. It is a visual opt-in, so there is no codemod.

Note that `size` loses to an explicit height: `rowHeight` and `headerHeight` are AG Grid grid options, and a grid option beats the theme parameter `size` sets. Setting `size: large` alongside `rowHeight: 30` gives 30 pixel rows under a 54 pixel header — use one or the other.

**AG Grid v33.** The package moves from `@ag-grid-community/*@32` to `ag-grid-community` + `ag-grid-react@33.3.2`, with `AllCommunityModule` registered explicitly. The Theming API is v33's default and class-based file themes are gone, so no block imports AG Grid CSS any more.

**The Balham, Alpine and Material blocks change appearance slightly.** They are kept indefinitely with the same API and the same names, but they now render AG Grid's prebuilt Theming API equivalents of those themes, with the antd colour mapping carried across as theme parameters. No config change is needed. What shifts:

- Spacing and header weight move a little — Balham rows go 28px to 29px, cell horizontal padding tightens on Balham and Alpine, the wrapper corner radius now comes from each theme (Balham 2px, Alpine 3px, Material 0) rather than a uniform 6px, and Balham's header weight goes from 600 to bold. Icons come from each theme's own SVG set, so glyph shapes differ from the old icon font.
- Row height now tracks the app's antd font size on Balham and Material, because v33 derives it from the data font size. It was font-size-independent before. The height only moves once the font size passes the theme's icon size (16px on Balham, 18px on Material), so at antd's default 14px nothing changes — you will see it at 18px or 20px. Alpine is unaffected at any font size.
- Four colours are re-pointed: row hover is a neutral fill rather than a primary tint, borders are lighter, the checkbox outline tone changes, and popup shadows are softer.
- Zebra striping, fonts and overall row density are preserved.

**A new `themeParams` property, on all eight blocks.** `themeParams` takes AG Grid Theming API parameter names and merges them onto the block's theme — the recommended way to retint a single grid:

```yaml
- id: my_table
  type: AgGridLowdefy
  properties:
    themeParams:
      headerBackgroundColor: '#1a1a2e'
      headerTextColor: '#e0e0ff'
      borderColor: var(--ant-color-primary)
```

Values are CSS strings and may reference antd tokens. Neither Lowdefy nor AG Grid validates parameter names, so a misspelled key is a silent no-op — check spelling against AG Grid's theming parameter reference.

Overriding `--ag-*` variables through a block's `style` — the documented `custom_theme` technique — **still works**; the Theming API honours an ancestor's declaration by design. The one caveat is that v33 renamed or folded away a number of the v32 `--ag-*` variables, and an override naming one of those is now a silent no-op. `--ag-header-foreground-color`, which appears in the documented example, is the case to watch: it is now `headerTextColor` (`--ag-header-text-color`). The AgGrid docs page carries the mapping table.

**One deprecation warning existing apps may see.** `rowSelection: multiple` / `single` is deprecated in v33 in favour of `rowSelection: { mode: multiRow }` / `{ mode: singleRow }`. The string form still works. If you migrate it, three things must move together:

- **Set `enableClickSelection: true`.** The string form defaults click-to-select on; the object form defaults it **off**. A bare `{ mode: singleRow }` silently stops clicking a row from selecting it, and `onRowSelected` / `onSelectionChanged` stop firing. The object form is not equivalent without this.
- **Move the colDef flags in the same edit.** `checkboxSelection` and `headerCheckboxSelection` on a column become `rowSelection.checkboxes` and `rowSelection.headerCheckbox`. v33 only supports `headerCheckboxSelection` alongside the *string* form, so migrating one without the other breaks the header checkbox.
- **Six sibling options are read only in the string branch and are silently lost on migration:** `suppressRowClickSelection`, `suppressRowDeselection`, `rowMultiSelectWithClick`, `groupSelectsChildren`, `groupSelectsFiltered` and `isRowSelectable`. All six are deprecated in favour of `rowSelection.*` — move any you use across.

**Dark-mode apps now get dark browser chrome throughout (`@lowdefy/client`, `@lowdefy/server`, `@lowdefy/server-dev`, `@lowdefy/server-e2e`).** `color-scheme` is now set on `<html>` from the resolved dark-mode state — in the client's dark-mode effect and in each server's pre-hydration inline script, so first paint matches too. Native scrollbars, `<select>` dropdowns, date pickers and autofill backgrounds render dark in a dark app, inside grids and everywhere else. This is an app-wide behaviour change, well beyond AgGrid, and it is what lets the grid's own scrollbars follow dark mode. Apps pinned to light with `theme.darkMode: light` are unaffected, including on a dark OS. Apps that leave `theme.darkMode` unset get the default, `system`, so on a dark OS they resolve to dark and do pick up `color-scheme: dark` — set `theme.darkMode: light` if that is not wanted.
