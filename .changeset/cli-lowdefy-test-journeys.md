'lowdefy': minor
---

Add `lowdefy test`, which runs an app's config tests: the journeys committed in `tests/journeys/*.yaml`. Each journey names a page, an optional inline user object and a list of declarative steps (`click`, `fill`, `select`, `press`, `wait`, `screenshot`, `expect`). The command boots the development server headless on a free port (or targets a running one with `--url`), runs every journey through `POST /lowdefy-docs/journey`, prints `PASS`/`FAIL` per journey with the failing step's index, `expected` and `actual`, and exits `1` when any journey fails. `--filter <name>` narrows the run. Journey files are validated against a schema; an invalid file is reported as a failed journey without aborting the run.
