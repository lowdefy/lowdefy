Add `lowdefy test`, which runs an app's config tests: the journeys committed in `tests/journeys/*.yaml`. Each journey names a page, an optional inline user object and a list of declarative steps (`click`, `fill`, `select`, `press`, `wait`, `screenshot`, `expect`). The command boots the development server headless on a free port (or targets a running one with `--url`), runs every journey through `POST /lowdefy-docs/journey`, prints `PASS`/`FAIL` per journey with the failing step's index, `expected` and `actual`, and exits `1` when any journey fails. `--filter <name>` narrows the run. Journey files are validated against a schema; an invalid file is reported as a failed journey without aborting the run.

- **Journeys fail at the step that causes an app error**: an action that fails with an error that is not a user error, an uncaught exception or an error the page reports, a request or endpoint that throws on the server, or a 5xx from one. Errors raised while the first page opens (its `onInit` and `onMount` requests) fail the journey on open. `lowdefy test` prints the step and each error's kind, message and config file and line; the journey route's result carries them as `failure.errors`, each with a stable finding key. Only errors a journey's own browsers cause count, and they are reported in its result, not in the dev server's build status or event stream. Expected outcomes never fail a journey: a failed `Validate`, a `Throw` action or any other user error, and 401 or 403 refusals. Where an error is the outcome the app means, assert it with `expect: { error: <text> }` straight after the interaction that raises it: it claims that interaction's errors whose message contains the text, and fails when none does.
- **Every reference is checked before its step runs.** A blockId, request, endpoint or `goto` page the step names that is not in the app's build, or an `as` name that is not a data set user, fails the step naming the unknown id.
- **`wait: { request }` waits for a fresh call**: one started since the last interaction (or since the page opened, before the first). `wait: 3000` is shorthand for `wait: { ms: 3000 }`.
- **The step grammar is a JSON schema**: `GET /lowdefy-docs/schema/journey-step/all` returns every step and `/lowdefy-docs/schema/journey-step/wait` one step, the `lowdefy_get_schema` MCP tool takes `kind: "journey-step"`, and `@lowdefy/node-utils` exports it as `journeyStepSchema`.
