feat: dates, numbers, avatars and copy buttons in HTML.

- **Dates.** `<time datetime="…" data-time="relative">` shows "3 hours ago" and keeps it current, with the exact time on hover. `date`, `datetime` and `time` use the app's locale, and any other value is a dayjs format. Dates show in the reader's time zone.
- **Numbers.** `data-format` formats the element's number as `number`, `currency` (with `data-currency="USD"`), `percent`, `compact` or `bytes`, with the same formatting as the ag-grid `number` cells; `data-decimals` fixes the decimals.
- **Avatars.** `data-avatar="Jane Doe"` renders initials in a theme colour, the same as the ag-grid `avatar` cells, and on an `<img>` replaces a missing or broken image. No image service is called.
- **Copy.** `data-copy` adds an accessible copy button for the element's text or the attribute's value. The copy and check icons are always bundled, and the labels are the new `client.copy`, `client.copyValue`, `client.copied` and `client.copyFailed` translation keys.
