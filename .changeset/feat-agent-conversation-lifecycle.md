feat(agents): persist full conversations, auto-mint conversation ids, and generate titles.

- **onFinish messages (fix):** the agent `onFinish` hook payload `messages` previously contained only the request input, so a `save-conversation` hook persisted the user's turns but never the assistant reply. `handleAgentChat` now captures the final UI message list (input plus the generated assistant message, including tool parts) from the stream's `onFinish` on both the default and prune paths, falling back to the input only when the stream errors or aborts. This repairs server-side conversation persistence.
- **generateTitle:** new AISDKAgent `generateTitle` boolean option. When `true`, the first turn generates a short title from the first user message with a one-shot `generateText` call that runs concurrently with the response and emits a `data-chat-title` data part, firing the `AgentChat` block's `onTitleGenerated` event. Off by default; failures are non-fatal.
- **conversationId minting:** when no `conversationId` property is set, `AgentChat` now mints a stable session id at mount and uses it for every request, so a turn sent before the app assigns an id (e.g. clicking a welcome prompt) no longer posts with an undefined id. The effective id is surfaced once per conversation, on its first user message, via a new `onConversationStart` event. App-supplied `conversationId` values remain authoritative.
