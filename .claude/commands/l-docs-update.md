# Update Documentation

Update cc-docs based on code changes in the Lowdefy monorepo and extract insights from the current session.

## Usage

```
/l-docs-update #123              # Based on PR
/l-docs-update feature/branch    # Based on branch diff from main
/l-docs-update path/to/file.js   # Based on specific files
/l-docs-update                   # Auto-detect from current branch/uncommitted
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identify Context

**For PR (recommended):**
```bash
gh pr view {number} --json number,title,body,headRefName,baseRefName,url
gh pr diff {number} --name-only
```

**For branch:**
```bash
git diff main...{branch} --name-only
```

**For uncommitted:**
```bash
git status --porcelain
git diff --name-only
```

If no context found, inform user:
> "No changes detected. Provide a PR number, branch name, or file paths."

### Phase 2: Analyze Session for Insights

Review the current conversation and code changes for:

**Architectural Decisions**
- Why was a particular approach chosen?
- What trade-offs were considered?
- What constraints influenced the design?

**Code Patterns**
- New patterns others should follow
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Helper utilities used repeatedly

**Debugging Insights**
- Non-obvious root causes discovered
- Diagnostic approaches that worked
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

**Integration Knowledge**
- How components interact
- Data flow through the system
- External dependencies and their quirks

### Phase 3: Categorize Changes

Map changes to documentation areas:

| File Pattern | Affected Doc |
|--------------|--------------|
| `packages/{pkg}/src/**` | `cc-docs/packages/{pkg}.md` |
| `packages/plugins/{cat}/{plugin}/**` | `cc-docs/plugins/{cat}/{plugin}.md` |
| `packages/plugins/{cat}/**` | `cc-docs/plugins/{cat}/overview.md` |
| `packages/servers/**` | `cc-docs/architecture/*.md` |
| `turbo.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | `cc-docs/Overview.md` |

Map insights to documentation:

| Insight Type | Target Location |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Architecture decisions | `cc-docs/architecture/` |
| Package internals | `cc-docs/packages/{package}.md` |
| Plugin details | `cc-docs/plugins/{type}/{name}.md` |
| Philosophy/principles | `cc-docs/Philosophy.md` |

### Phase 4: Determine What to Update

**Do update when:**
- New public exports added
- Module structure changes
- Dependencies added/removed between packages
- Significant behavior changes
- New patterns introduced
- Architectural decisions made

**Skip when:**
- Test file changes only
- Dependency version bumps
- Formatting/linting fixes
- Internal refactors (same external behavior)
- Work is incomplete and patterns aren't clear

### Phase 5: Update Documentation

For each doc that needs updating:

1. **Read existing doc completely**
2. **Read changed source files**
3. **Identify sections to update:**
   - New modules → add to "Key Modules"
   - New exports → add to "Files Quick Reference"
   - New dependencies → update "Dependencies"
   - Behavior changes → update relevant sections
   - Decisions → add to "Decision Trace" or create architecture doc
4. **Preserve existing content** - only update affected sections
5. **Update frontmatter** `updated:` date

**Documentation principles:**
- Clarity over brevity
- Include the "why", not just the "what"
- Use real examples from the PR when possible
- Link to source: `packages/build/src/buildPages.js:45`
- Avoid speculation - only document what was discovered

### Phase 6: Validate

```bash
# Check for broken internal links
grep -r "\]\(./" cc-docs/ | grep -v "^Binary"
```

**Accuracy checks:**
- Property/type names match actual schema files
- Counts are actual, not estimated
- External library links are valid
- Context parameters are complete

### Phase 7: Post PR Comment (if PR context)

```bash
gh pr comment {PR_NUMBER} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Documentation Updates

)"
```

### Phase 8: Report

```markdown
## Documentation Update Summary

**Source:** PR #123 / branch feature/x / uncommitted changes

### Changes Analyzed
- {count} files changed
- {count} packages affected

### Documentation Updates

**Updated:**
- `cc-docs/packages/engine.md` - Added new state hook section

**Skipped (non-behavioral):**
- `packages/engine/src/utils.test.js` - Test only

### Insights Captured
1. {insight summary}
2. {insight summary}
```

## Constraints

1. **Don't invent insights** - Only document things that actually came up
2. **Preserve existing docs** - Read before editing, add don't replace
3. **Follow CLAUDE.md standards** - All code examples must follow patterns
4. **No speculation** - If uncertain, note as "needs investigation"
5. **Attribution** - Reference the PR/issue that prompted the doc
6. **Keep cc-docs technical** - For Claude Code, not end users

## When NOT to Update

Skip if:
- Session was purely exploratory with no conclusions
- Changes are trivial (typos, formatting)
- Work is incomplete and patterns aren't clear
- Documentation already exists and is accurate

Inform user: "No documentation updates needed. {reason}"
