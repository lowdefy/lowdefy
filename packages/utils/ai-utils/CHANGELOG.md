## 6.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 6d6f8fa: Improved error handling: each reader of a server error now gets its own view of it.

  - **Users and app config see the author's message or one generic message.** A server error the app author did not write now reaches the browser as "Something went wrong.", with its `name`, `code`, `statusCode`, `configKey` and a `requestId`. Messages written with `:throw` or `:reject`, failed `ValidateSchema` steps, a plugin's `UserError`, and authentication refusals, are shown as before. This applies to the error toast, `_actions`, `_request_details`, websocket errors, MCP tool results and the AgentChat stream, the same way in development and production. An action whose error toast showed a connection's own message now shows the generic one.
    - The generic message is the built-in `server.genericError` i18n string. Override it per locale under `config.i18n.messages`, for example `server.genericError: 'Etwas ist schiefgelaufen.'`.
    - To show different text for one action, set `messages.error` on the action.
    - To show the real message, read it with the new `_error` operator in the endpoint's `:catch` and send it on, for example `:throw: { _error: message }`.
  - **The dev server shows the full error.** In `lowdefy dev`, the error bar, the browser console and the dev MCP tools show the full server error, with its config location, while app config sees the same generic error as in production. Different failures of the same action are now each shown, instead of only the first.
  - **The browser console prints the request id** under a server error, to find the matching server log line and Sentry event.
  - **Production logs and Sentry keep a fixed set of error fields.** Each logged error keeps its name, message, stack, `code`, `statusCode` and cause, plus Lowdefy's own fields (`configKey`, `source`, `received`, ...) on Lowdefy errors. Fields a library attaches, such as an HTTP client's request config and response, are no longer logged. Values of the app's secrets (`LOWDEFY_SECRET_*`, `CRON_SECRET`, `AUTH_SECRET`) are replaced with `[REDACTED]` in production log lines and Sentry events, and credential-named keys in `received` are masked. Sentry events now carry the error's fields under `extra.error` and a `requestId` tag, and no longer attach incoming request bodies.
  - **An AxiosHttp request that gets a 5xx response now fails with a `ServiceError`**, where it used to fail with a `RequestError`. AxiosHttp now sets `statusCode` on its error, and a 5xx status marks an error as a service failure, like a network error or timeout. Config that checks `name` for `RequestError` on these failures, for example `_eq: [{ _error: name }, 'RequestError']`, should also accept `ServiceError`, or check `statusCode` instead. The server log event for these failures is now `service_error`.

### Minor Changes

- b496a77: feat: AI in API routines — one-shot LLM requests and CallAgent steps

  **One-shot LLM request types (`@lowdefy/connection-anthropic`, `@lowdefy/connection-openai`, `@lowdefy/connection-google`, `@lowdefy/connection-ai-gateway`)**

  All AI provider connections now provide `GenerateText` and `GenerateObject` request types — single model calls usable as API routine steps and page requests. The type names are shared across providers, so switching providers only means changing the `connectionId`.

  - `GenerateText` generates text from a prompt and returns `{ text, reasoningText, finishReason, usage }`.
  - `GenerateObject` generates structured data matching a JSON Schema and returns `{ object, finishReason, usage }` — ideal for classify, extract, and routing decisions inside routines.

  ```yaml
  routine:
    - id: classify
      type: GenerateObject
      connectionId: claude
      properties:
        model: claude-haiku-4-5
        prompt:
          _payload: ticket_text
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            category: { type: string }
  ```

  **CallAgent routine step (`@lowdefy/api`, `@lowdefy/build`, `@lowdefy/ai-utils`)**

  API endpoint routines can now run an agent to completion with the new `CallAgent` step. The agent runs headlessly — no chat UI, no streaming — looping through its tools until done, and stores `{ text, finishReason, usage, toolCalls, toolResults }` in `_step`.

  ```yaml
  routine:
    - id: research
      type: CallAgent
      properties:
        agentId: research_agent
        prompt: Summarize yesterday's signups and flag anomalies.
  ```

  - Tools marked `confirm: true` auto-execute in headless runs (the build emits a warning — there is no client to approve them).
  - Agent server hooks still fire; `onFinish` `dataParts` are ignored since there is no stream.
  - Agent tool and hook endpoint calls now count toward the endpoint call depth cap of 10, so recursive agent/endpoint configurations terminate with an error.
  - The build validates that a static `agentId` on a `CallAgent` step references an existing agent.

### Patch Changes

- 11662bc: fix(ai): a failed agent turn no longer poisons the conversation. The chat client pushes the assistant message on the stream's `start` chunk, so a request that failed after that left an assistant message with no parts in the history; every later send then failed UIMessage validation, and the error toast dumped the whole conversation as JSON. AgentChat now drops empty assistant shells on error, the agent handler ignores empty messages and redacts validation errors, and a validation failure is logged like any other stream fault.
- 8396857: fix(ai-utils): Give the assistant message an id so persisted transcripts render correctly.

  `handleAgentChat` passed no `generateMessageId` to the AI SDK, so the assistant message delivered to
  the stream-level `onFinish` arrived with an empty id. An `onFinish` hook that saves the conversation
  therefore stored every assistant message under the same id, and reloading that conversation collapsed
  the transcript: `AgentChat` keys its bubbles by message id and looks each bubble's parts up by that id,
  so every assistant bubble rendered the last reply. User messages were unaffected, and a live turn
  looked correct because the client generates its own id while streaming — the damage only appeared once
  the conversation was reopened. Both stream paths (with and without `prune`) now pass the SDK's
  `generateId`.

## 5.6.0

### Patch Changes

- 3ead269: feat(helpers): Reject prototype-pollution key names in dot paths and key maps.

  `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__`,
  `__lookupGetter__` and `__lookupSetter__` are no longer accepted as path segments or as keys
  in maps built from user-supplied values.

  Previously these names were silently _filtered_ on write, which was worse than rejecting
  them: `SetState: { 'a.__proto__.b': 1 }` quietly wrote to `a.b` instead — a different
  location than the one you asked for. Reads could also walk up the prototype chain.

  What you will see now:

  - `:set_state` and the `SetState` action raise a config error naming the offending key and
    pointing at the line in your YAML.
  - Data-reading operators (`_state`, `_get`, `_user`, `_payload`, ...) return their default
    instead of a value.
  - A module entry id, an agent or endpoint id, or a `LOWDEFY_SECRET_*` environment variable
    using one of these names now fails at build or boot with a message naming it, instead of
    silently vanishing.

  Apps that do not use these names are unaffected. If you have a form field, state key, or API
  response property named `constructor`, rename it.

  Deep merges of configuration are hardened the same way, but skip reserved keys rather than
  raising — a reserved name arriving inside a merged _value_ is dropped so a single poisoned
  field can't abort an otherwise valid merge.

  `@lowdefy/helpers` also now exports `isReserved(key)`, so plugin and connection authors can
  test a key against this policy directly instead of catching a `ReservedKeyError`.

### Minor Changes

- ff7ed66: feat(agents): persist full conversations, auto-mint conversation ids, and generate titles.

  - **onFinish messages (fix):** the agent `onFinish` hook payload `messages` previously contained only the request input, so a `save-conversation` hook persisted the user's turns but never the assistant reply. `handleAgentChat` now captures the final UI message list (input plus the generated assistant message, including tool parts) from the stream's `onFinish` on both the default and prune paths, falling back to the input only when the stream errors or aborts. This repairs server-side conversation persistence.
  - **generateTitle:** new AISDKAgent `generateTitle` boolean option. When `true`, the first turn generates a short title from the first user message with a one-shot `generateText` call that runs concurrently with the response and emits a `data-chat-title` data part, firing the `AgentChat` block's `onTitleGenerated` event. Off by default; failures are non-fatal.
  - **conversationId minting:** when no `conversationId` property is set, `AgentChat` now mints a stable session id at mount and uses it for every request, so a turn sent before the app assigns an id (e.g. clicking a welcome prompt) no longer posts with an undefined id. The effective id is surfaced once per conversation, on its first user message, via a new `onConversationStart` event. App-supplied `conversationId` values remain authoritative.

- f11addd: feat: Extend i18n coverage to Lowdefy agents.

  Builds on the i18n / locale support from
  `feat-i18n-locale-support.md`. End-user-visible strings in the agent
  runtime and the `AgentChat` block now localize automatically when
  `config.i18n` is configured.

  **Agent runtime errors.** HTTP 4xx/5xx responses from the agent
  endpoint (`Only POST requests are supported.`, `Invalid agent path`,
  `Agent "X" does not exist.`, `Agent type "Y" can not be found.`,
  `Endpoint execution failed`, etc.) translate per request via the
  `Accept-Language` header against `agent.runtime.*` builtin keys.

  **AgentChat block UI.** Framework-rendered strings in the chat UI go
  through `methods.translate` against new `agent.*` builtin keys:

  - `agent.sender.placeholder` — `'Type a message...'`
  - `agent.toolApproval.{approve,reject}` — `'Approve'` / `'Reject'`
  - `agent.message.{copy,feedback,regenerate,delete}` — message actions
  - `agent.toolResult.{completed,completedNoData,empty,emptyList,showMore,showLess}` — tool result captions

  Override per locale via `config.i18n.messages.{locale}` — same
  mechanism as any other built-in message.

  **antd X locale wiring.** The app shell now uses
  `@ant-design/x@2.7.x`'s `XProvider` at the root (drop-in superset of
  antd's `ConfigProvider`) with a merged antd + antd-X locale pack.
  antd X ships only `en_US` and `zh_CN` packs; other locales fall back
  to `en_US` for X-native strings (`'New chat'`, `'Stop loading'`,
  `'Like'`/`'Dislike'`, bubble edit `'OK'`/`'Cancel'`). Apps can
  override these in unsupported locales via the new `agent.antdx.*`
  reference keys.

  **Plugin-author surface.** Agent hook endpoints (`onStart`,
  `onStepStart`, `onToolCallStart`, `onToolCallFinish`, `onStepFinish`,
  `onFinish`) now receive `locale: <activeCode>` in their payload, so
  hook routines can branch on the user's locale.

  **System prompt translation.** `agent.properties.instructions` passes
  through the operator parser at request time — `_t:` works there for
  locale-aware system prompts.

  ```yaml
  agents:
    - id: assistant
      type: AISDKAgent
      connectionId: anthropic
      properties:
        agent:
          model: claude-sonnet-4
          instructions:
            _t: agent.systemPrompt
  ```

  **What stays English** (explicit choices):

  - Built-in tool descriptions used in the model prompt (English-trained
    models perform best with English tool descriptions).
  - Build-time agent validation errors (developer diagnostics).
  - Console warnings (ops diagnostics).
  - The `[File truncated — showing first NKB...]` notice in the
    `read-file` built-in tool (model-facing).
  - Model-streamed natural-language output (owned by the model).
