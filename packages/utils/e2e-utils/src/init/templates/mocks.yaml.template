# E2E Request Mocks
# Define mocked responses for requests that can't run in test environments
# (Atlas Search, vector search, external APIs, etc.)

mocks:
  # Example: Mock a MongoDB Atlas Search request
  # atlas_search:
  #   response:
  #     - _id: doc-1
  #       title: Search Result
  #       score: 0.95

  # Example: Mock an external API endpoint
  # external_api:
  #   type: api
  #   method: POST
  #   response:
  #     results: []
  #     total: 0
