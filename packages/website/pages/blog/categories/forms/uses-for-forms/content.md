# 10 Great Uses for Forms in Lowdefy

Lowdefy's focus is business web apps, where data collection and analysis are a priority.
These kinds of tasks require flexible and intelligent forms, which Lowdefy makes very easy to create and implement.

## Use Cases

### User Details

By far the most important task in a web app is capturing user details.
Being able to create user accounts greatly extends the capabilities of your app.

Lowdefy facilitates Role-based Access Control for different types of users.
Customer and employee accounts can be assigned roles on creation, giving them access to the relevant views and features.

It also aids in data consolidation, with a single source of truth for each individual. This can include more than just the contact details themselves, such as a history of employee interactions with a customer.

### Inventory Management

Specialist industries and service providers work with unique sets of data.
Generic inventory management systems are not designed with these types of data in mind.

Lowdefy allows for in-depth customisation to manage exactly the data you need.

Along with general information such as pricing and description, you can use Lowdefy forms to view and modify details specific to your products and services.

Other use cases include checking and logging stock levels, adding new items, and updating existing ones.

Processes can be automated for purchasing and sales data analysis.

### Client Updates

Lowdefy forms are extremely useful in the automation of ticketing systems.

A great example is the bespoke support management system we built for Ingrain.
This implementation allowed their various departments to focus on the behind-the-scenes processes while the system itself kept the client updated at every step.

### Record Keeping

Lowdefy forms are designed to ensure data is collected with accuracy and consistency.

Features such as dropdown selections, autocomplete and data validation prevent input errors, and greatly improve User Experience.

This consistency is essential for a Single Source of Truth, consolidating relevant data in a single place for more convenient access.

### Report Generation

Lowdefy's excellent data organisation functionality makes it easy to generate documentation and reports.

Forms can be designed to select the required data, which will autopopulate a clean and well-formatted document.
Data captured with these forms can be exported as a PDF to be presented to clients or for internal use.

### Shift Management

Forms can be used to streamline employee scheduling and shift tracking.

For example, they can be configured to record employees clocking in and out to track the hours worked by each employee.

Another use case would be to request shift changes that can be approved by management.

### Site Management

Lowdefy forms can be used to track tasks and processes at relevant locations.
This could include investigations for root cause analysis, or to track maintenance and other issues.

### Internal Process Management

Even if each task is performed optimally, bottlenecks in internal processes can occur between these steps.

Lowdefy forms can be used to streamline handover and escalation to allow everyone in the team to focus on the task itself.

### Customer Feedback and Analysis

Survey forms created with Lowdefy can collect extremely useful data with minimal time and effort from the customer.

Customers can quickly and conveniently express their thoughts, and tag them according to their level of satisfaction.

The feedback collected can then be filtered to identify areas for improvement and further optimisation.
