## 6.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 6730996: feat: Provider-neutral file storage — upload and download files to S3-compatible providers, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.

  **Generic file blocks (`@lowdefy/blocks-files`, new)**

  - New `Upload`, `UploadPhoto`, `UploadDragger`, and `Download` blocks that work with any storage provider. Upload blocks call an upload-policy request by id (`uploadPolicyRequestId`) and support both POST form uploads (S3, R2, MinIO, GCS) and PUT body uploads (Azure SAS), with upload progress on both.
  - `emitFileContent: true` reads the file in the browser and emits `{ name, size, type, content }` (base64) as the block value and `onChange` event, for storing files through an API endpoint routine with a server-side write request.

  **S3-compatible providers (`@lowdefy/plugin-aws`)**

  - `AwsS3Bucket` connections accept `endpoint` and `forcePathStyle`, unlocking Cloudflare R2, MinIO, DigitalOcean Spaces, Backblaze B2, and Wasabi with a one-line config change.
  - `AwsS3PresignedGetObject` returns a stable, non-expiring public URL when the request sets `public: true`; the connection-level `publicUrlBase` overrides the constructed URL for CDN domains.
  - New `AwsS3PutObject` write and `AwsS3GetObject` read requests store and read base64 object content from endpoint routines or page requests, so routines can process file content in steps.
  - The `S3UploadButton`, `S3UploadPhoto`, `S3UploadDragger`, and `S3Download` blocks are now deprecated aliases of the generic blocks — existing apps keep working unchanged.

  **Google Cloud Storage (`@lowdefy/plugin-gcp`, new)**

  - `GoogleCloudStorageBucket` connection with `GcsSignedPostPolicy`, `GcsSignedGetUrl`, `GcsGetObject`, and `GcsPutObject` requests.

  **Azure Blob Storage (`@lowdefy/plugin-azure`, new)**

  - `AzureBlobContainer` connection with `AzureBlobUploadSas`, `AzureBlobDownloadSas`, `AzureBlobGet`, and `AzureBlobPut` requests.

  **Editor and chat uploads (`@lowdefy/blocks-tiptap`, `@lowdefy/blocks-antd-x`)**

  - Tiptap editors and AgentChat attachments now upload through the shared provider-neutral flow. New `uploadPolicyRequestId` and `downloadPolicyRequestId` properties replace `s3PostPolicyRequestId` (kept as a deprecated alias). Inline image and attachment URLs resolve through the download request when configured.

  **Servers (`@lowdefy/server`, `@lowdefy/server-dev`)**

  - `/api/endpoints/*` request bodies are capped at 10 MiB (matching the agent route), bounding base64 file payloads sent via `CallAPI`.

  **Codemod (`@lowdefy/codemods`)**

  - Optional `s3-blocks-to-file-blocks` codemod renames the deprecated S3\* blocks and `s3PostPolicyRequestId`/`s3GetPolicyRequestId` properties to the provider-neutral names via `lowdefy upgrade`.

### Patch Changes

- 28cb944: feat: Dev server docs and MCP endpoint for AI coding agents

  The dev server now always serves documentation for everything installed in your project — every block, operator, action, connection and request type, from core plugins and your own local plugins — plus the full Lowdefy docs as markdown.

  **Docs API and MCP endpoint (`@lowdefy/server-dev`)**

  - Plain GET routes under `/lowdefy-docs`: list all available types per kind, JSON schemas per type, block usage examples, docs pages as markdown, and search.
  - An MCP endpoint (streamable HTTP) at `/lowdefy-docs/mcp` exposing the same as tools (`lowdefy_list_types`, `lowdefy_get_schema`, `lowdefy_get_examples`, `lowdefy_get_doc`, ...) so agents like Claude Code can look up exact type contracts instead of guessing.
  - The `/lowdefy-docs` page path prefix is now reserved in dev.

  **Discovery build artifacts (`@lowdefy/build`)**

  - Dev builds now write `plugins/availableTypes.json` (every installed type, used or not) and `plugins/connectionSchemas.json` + `plugins/requestSchemas.json` (collected from connection definitions).
  - Fixed custom/local plugin schemas being silently missing from all schema maps — plugin modules now also resolve from the server directory.

  **Docs content package (`@lowdefy/docs-content`)**

  - New package shipping the Lowdefy docs extracted as markdown with a manifest, generated from the docs app build (`pnpm docs:content`).

  **Block plugins**

  - Block packages now publish their `gallery.yaml`/`examples.yaml`/`tests.yaml` files in `dist/`, so the docs API can serve real examples.
