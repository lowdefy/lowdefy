- 662eaa9: feat: Tenant wall — multi-tenant isolation on MongoDB connections, scoped by default

  `auth.organizations.policy` sets the scoping default for every connection in the app. Under `policy: tenant`, every connection whose type implements the scoping contract is walled to the caller's active organization — enforced mechanically on reads **and** writes, with nothing to declare per connection and no per-request filters to remember. A connection declares only its **exception** to that default: `tenant: shared`, for data deliberately shared across organizations, or `tenant: { field: ... }` to scope on a non-default field. A connection carries no default of its own — the same connection file is scoped in a `tenant` app and unscoped in a `pinned` one, with nothing in the file about tenancy.

  **The wall is policy-conditional.** It engages only when the app declares `auth.organizations.policy: tenant`. Under `pinned` (the default, including apps with no `organizations:` block) no connection is scoped and none can be — the wall applies nothing: no read filter, no write stamp, no selector merge, no change-stream scoping, no authored-clause audit, no fail-closed error for organization-less callers, and no rejection of an authored tenant field. A single-organization deployment therefore adopts scoping-capable connections with no data migration — no backfill, no index changes. One check stays on under both policies: declaring `tenant:` on a connection type that does not implement the scoping contract is a config error, so it surfaces on the current deployment rather than on the day the app flips to `tenant`. `_build.authConfig` projects `organizations.policy`, so config can branch on the policy at build time, including in module entry vars and cross-module components consumed through them. (Reading it inside the `auth:` block itself, or in app metadata, is a build error.)

  **Tenant preflight.** Under `policy: tenant` the server probes every walled collection (lazily, once per process) for documents missing the tenant field or carrying it as `null` — rows no walled read can see. It keeps serving and reports each offending collection once: a `TenantIntegrityError` log line and a Sentry event tagged with collection, connection and endpoint. A probe that cannot reach the database logs a warning and retries on the next request. The probe is a connection-type capability (`tenantPreflight`, implemented by `MongoDBCollection`); the walled set — every scoping-capable connection that does not declare `tenant: shared` — is enumerated from the `tenantConnections.json` build artifact.

  **Tenant wall (`@lowdefy/connection-mongodb`, `@lowdefy/api`)**

  - Every find/findOne/update/delete selector is merged with the caller's organization equality; every insert, replacement, and upsert is stamped server-side with the organization id. Every insert into a walled collection (including upserts, bulk writes, table changes and the version copy of a versioned update) is read back by `_id`; a row missing the tenant field or carrying another organization is deleted and the request fails with `TenantIntegrityError`.
  - Aggregation pipelines: the wall's one pipeline move is prepending the tenant `$match` at every pipeline entry — the root pipeline and every `$lookup` (both forms) / `$unionWith` sub-pipeline entry, recursing through `$facet` branches. The wall never rewrites the inside of a stage. `$out`/`$merge` are rejected on tenant connections, and `$collStats`/`$indexStats` too — collection-level statistics cannot be tenant-scoped.
  - Stages the prepend cannot scope — a pipeline-leading `$search`/`$searchMeta`/`$vectorSearch`/`$geoNear`, and `$graphLookup` at any position — are **refused** unless the request declares `tenant: authored`: the request then authors the tenant clause itself (a `compound.filter` `equals` for `$search`/`$searchMeta`, the `filter` for `$vectorSearch`, the `query` for `$geoNear`, `restrictSearchWithMatch` for `$graphLookup`, typically with `_user: organization_id` as the value), and the wall **audits** it at runtime — clause present, tenant field, value strictly equal to the caller's resolved organization — refusing to run on any miss. The rest of an authored request's pipeline is still walled mechanically, and the caller must still resolve an organization. Atlas index requirements for authored clauses: the tenant field `token`-mapped in the Atlas Search index (and in `storedSource` where `returnStoredSource` is used); indexed as the `filter` type for Atlas Vector Search.
  - Change streams are scoped via a `fullDocument` match with `updateLookup` forced; events that cannot prove they match (deletes) are not delivered, and callers from different organizations never share a change-stream channel.
  - The tenant field may be read but never authored in a write or filter position — authored usage is rejected loudly. In writes this means a top-level key of an insert or replacement document or of an update operator's argument; a nested key of that name inside stored data is ordinary data. (On a `tenant: authored` request the audited stage position is the one place it is instead _required_.)
  - Fail-closed everywhere under `policy: tenant`: system-context and strategy callers carry no organization, so their requests to tenant connections fail. A read fails with an `AuthenticationError` unless the request or step declares `tenant: none`, the only opt-out, authored at the point of use; `tenant: none` reads reach every organization's rows. A write in a run bound to no organization fails with `TenantIntegrityError` (naming the collection, connection and tenant field, logged at error level and sent to Sentry). To write from a caller-less run (a schedule, an auth hook, a verified webhook), call an endpoint with a `CallApi` step that names the `organization`: its requests run with the wall on, filtered and stamped with that organization.
  - **`tenant: none` is read-only.** A request, routine step or webhook verifier with `tenant: none` on a scoped connection whose type writes (`MongoDBInsertOne`, `MongoDBUpdateMany`, `MongoDBBulkWrite`, `MongoDBTableChanges`, the enrichment requests and the rest) fails the build with a `ConfigError` naming the step, request or verifier, its type and its connection, and the same write is refused at runtime. An aggregation with `$out` or `$merge` under `tenant: none` fails the build when the target is a literal collection name and is refused at runtime otherwise.
  - A `tenant: shared` connection over the same collection and database as a scoped connection (compared as authored; a collection name resolved at runtime is not compared) keeps unscoped reads, but every row it inserts, replaces, upserts or updates must keep a non-empty `organization_id`, and each `MongoDBBulkWrite` operation must name exactly one operation kind.
  - `context.user.organization_id` (the caller's active organization id) is exposed and readable as `_user: organization_id` under both organizations policies.

  **Walled MongoDB client for plugins**

  `@lowdefy/connection-mongodb/walled` exports `getWalledCollection`, a client whose `find`, `findOne`, `aggregate`, `countDocuments`, `insertOne`, `insertMany`, `updateOne`, `updateMany`, `findOneAndUpdate`, `deleteOne`, `deleteMany` and `bulkWrite` apply the wall exactly as the matching MongoDB requests do: scoped reads and writes, stamped and read-back inserts and upserts, change logs kept, `$out` and `$merge` refused, and every write method refused under `tenant: none`. A plugin's request resolver receives `walled(connectionId)` and passes its result to `getWalledCollection`. Under `policy: tenant`, a non-scopable connection (SMTP, a plugin's own connection type) may not reach a walled database: the build fails when such a connection reads the secret behind a walled connection's `databaseUri`, and when one holds a URI to a walled database under another secret or as a literal, the server logs an error at start and refuses that connection's requests with a `ConfigError` while the rest of the app keeps serving. There is no opt-out (`~ignoreBuildChecks` does not suppress it): give the plugin a `mongoConnectionId` and use `getWalledCollection`.

  **Build validation (`@lowdefy/build`)**

  - The connection position accepts only the exception: `tenant: shared`, or `tenant: { field: ... }`. Any `tenant:` declaration on a connection type that does not implement the scoping contract is a build error under both policies.
  - Connection types declare their tenancy capability in `connectionMetas`: `{ tenant: true }` implements the scoping contract (v1: `MongoDBCollection`), `{ tenant: false }` is non-scopable — every first-party connection type declares one or the other. Under `policy: tenant` a connection whose type declares neither is a build error naming the type, so a data-bearing custom type can never be silently unscoped. Connection plugins can also declare `requestMetas` (`{ checkRead, checkWrite }` per request type) in their `types.js`, which the build reads to know which request types write.
  - The request/step-level sentinel accepts `none` and `authored`; websockets accept `none` only (`authored` is aggregation-only). Declaring `none`/`authored` on a connection, or `shared`/`{ field }` on a request, is a build error naming the position the value belongs to.
  - Best-effort entry-stage check: a literal walled pipeline leading with `$search`/`$searchMeta`/`$vectorSearch`/`$geoNear` or containing `$graphLookup` without `tenant: authored` is a build error (operator-composed pipelines are checked at runtime, which is the enforcement gate). The check only runs under `policy: tenant` — under `pinned` the wall never engages, so a missing authored clause is not an error.
  - Shared connections and walled collections: a request or step on a `tenant: shared` connection whose literal aggregation pipeline writes into a scoped connection's collection with `$out` or `$merge` is a build error, and so is a `tenant: shared` connection whose `changeLog.collection` is a collection a scoped connection reads — give shared connections their own change-log collection. Both checks compare literal collection names and database properties as authored; `MongoDBCollection` declares the properties that name its collections in `connectionMetas.tenantTarget`.
  - Remap guard: a connection remap on a module entry swaps the module's whole connection definition for the app's — including its position against the wall. Under `policy: tenant`, remapping a scoped module connection to a target that is not scoped — one that declares `tenant: shared`, or whose type does not implement the scoping contract — is a build error (it would silently run the module's requests outside the wall). Remapping onto a target that declares nothing is safe: both sides are scoped. Under `pinned` remaps stay unrestricted; the flip to `tenant` is a rebuild, so the guard fires there.

  **Signup under `policy: tenant`**

  With `organizations.signup: open` and `create: auto`, a user without a membership gets a fresh organization, as its owner, at their next session — exactly one organization and one owner row even under concurrent sessions, and never an organization the user was a member of before. The server creates unique indexes on the organization `slug` and the member `(user, organization)` pair at startup (an equivalent index created by hand, under any name, is accepted). If they cannot be created — the database user lacks the privilege, or duplicate rows exist — the server logs an error naming the index, and a sign-in that needs a new organization is refused with status 503 and the code `ORGANIZATION_SETUP_UNAVAILABLE`; the server retries at most every 30 seconds, so a fix recovers without a restart.

  **Enabling the wall**

  Under `pinned`, adopting scoping-capable connections changes nothing — no migration, no new requirements, no declaration. Enforcement starts when the app declares `policy: tenant`, and that flip is deliberately breaking, in the fail-closed direction:

  - Documents without the tenant field fall outside every walled read — the tenant preflight names the collections to backfill.
  - Every system-context caller of the connection (webhook verifiers, hook routines, scheduled endpoints) and every strategy caller starts failing until it runs with an organization: reads can declare `tenant: none` at the point of use, writes go through `CallApi` with `organization`. Declaring `tenant: none` on a read is inert under `pinned`, so authoring it ahead of the flip is safe and recommended wherever a caller-less context reads a walled connection.

### Patch Changes

- a9442cc: Production pages load only the plugin code they use.

  The production client used to ship every block, action, operator and icon the app uses anywhere in one main bundle, and every first visit downloaded all of it. Now the build writes one small module per distinct page type set, and each page loads its own. On the docs app the main bundle drops from 6,016 kB to 1,021 kB (1,778 kB to 332 kB gzipped). A simple page's first load drops from 1,720 kB to 529 kB gzipped.

  - The HTML preloads the page's chunks alongside the main bundle, so the first page does not wait an extra round trip.
  - Content-hashed assets are served with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`, on the Node server and in `lowdefy vercel-output`.
  - Lowdefy's plugin packages declare `"sideEffects": ["**/*.css"]`, so a page that uses one block no longer loads the whole package.
  - The build adds the types a page runs without naming them: the operators the `_js` accessors call, and the actions and operators a block runs for events it registers itself (such as `Request` in `Upload` or `SetLocale` in `PageHeaderMenu`), which blocks list in `meta.actions` and `meta.operators`. Plugin blocks that register their own events should list them the same way.
  - A Dynamic block whose content uses a type its `properties.types` did not declare still works: the page loads the full type set and the server logs a warning naming the type to declare.

  No config changes. The dev server is unchanged.

- f430f02dde: Replace auto-generated `types.json` with source `types.js` files in all plugin packages.

  ### Breaking Changes

  - **Plugin type resolution**: Plugin types are now read from source `types.js` files instead of auto-generated `types.json`. Block packages derive types from their `metas.js` barrel using the `extractBlockTypes` helper.
  - **`extract-plugin-types` script removed**: The build-time extraction script in `@lowdefy/node-utils` has been deleted. Each plugin package maintains its own `types.js`.
