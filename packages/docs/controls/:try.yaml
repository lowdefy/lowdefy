    description: |
      If one control in the routine chain defined in the `:try` key fails by throwing an error, the steps in the list following the failed control will not be executed. To handle any errors thrown by a routine element, a routine can be provided using `catch` key.
      The routine defined using the `:finally` key will be run regardless of whether or not the routine throws an error.
    controlKeys: |
      - `:try: routine`: __Required__ - The routine to be run.
      - `:catch: routine`: The routine to execute if any step in the routine defined errors.
      - `:finally: routine`: The routine to be run regardless of the out come of the initial routine.
