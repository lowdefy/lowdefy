    description: |
      The `:while` control implements a while loop within a routine. The routine defined in the `:do` key will be repeated as long as the test defined using the `:while` key is true.
    controlKeys: |
      - `:while: boolean`: __Required__ - The test that will determine whether or not the defined routine should execute again.
      - `:do: routine`: __Required__ - The routine to run while the test condition holds.

            - _state: count
            - 5
        :do:
          - :log:
              _item: count
          - :set_state:
              count:
                _sum:
