    description: |
      The `:return` control immediately ends the execution of an API endpoint routine and returns a successful response with the specified data.
      Any routine steps after a `:return` are not executed. The control accepts any value type (objects, arrays, strings, numbers, null) and marks the API call as successful.
      When used within conditional controls like [`:if`](/:if) or [`:switch`](/:switch), it provides a way to exit early with a success status and return data to the client.
    controlKeys: |
      - `:return: any`: __Required__ - The value that will be returned in the response object of the API call result.
    examples: |
      ###### Return Step Result

      ```yaml
      - id: get_company
        type: MongoDBInsertOne
        connectionId: companies
        properties:
          doc:
            _id:
              _payload: company_id
      - :return:
          _step: get_company
      ```

      ###### Switch with multiple returns

      ```yaml
      - id: get_user_subscription
        type: MongoDBFindOne
        connectionId: subscriptions
        properties:
          query:
            user_id:
              _user: id
      - :switch:
          - :case:
              _not:
                _step: get_user_subscription
            :then:
              :return:
