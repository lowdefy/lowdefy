    description: |
      The `:if` control executes different routines based on a boolean condition. It evaluates the condition and runs the `:then` branch if true, or the optional `:else` branch if false. Generally other operators are used to evaluate the test.
    controlKeys: |
      - `:if: boolean`: __Required__ - The boolean result of a test or value.
      - `:then: routine`: __Required__ - The routine to execute if the test result is true.
      - `:else: routine`: The routine to execute if the test result is false.
    examples: |
