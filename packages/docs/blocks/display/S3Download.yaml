      The `S3Download` block allows a user to download a files from AWS S3.

      The `s3GetPolicyRequestId` property is required, and should be the `id` of a [`AwsS3PresignedGetPolicy`](/AWSS3) request. This request is called by the block when the user downloads a file, to create a policy that allows a file to be downloaded from AWS S3.

      If using files were uploaded using a S3Upload block, the `fileList` can be mapped to the `S3Download` block to allow the user to download the files, given the correct `AwsS3PresignedGetPolicy` is in defined.

      For the examples to work, a `AwsS3Bucket` connection is required. For example:
      ```yaml
        connections:
        - id: files
          type: AwsS3Bucket
          properties:
            accessKeyId:
              _secret: FILES_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            secretAccessKey:
              _secret: FILES_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            region: af-south-1
            bucket:
              _secret: FILES_S3_BUCKET
            write: true
      ```

      > The examples on this page are not setup with a [`AwsS3Bucket`](/AWSS3) connection, and thus will throw.
