      The `S3UploadPhoto` block allows a user to to upload a photo to AWS S3.

      The `s3PostPolicyRequestId` property is required, and should be the `id` of a [`AwsS3PresignedPostPolicy`](/AWSS3) request. This request is called by the block when the user uploads a file, to create a policy that allows a file to be uploaded to AWS S3.

      The block has an object value in state, with a `file` key, which has an object corresponding to the last uploaded file, and a `fileList` array with objects for each the files.

      For the examples to work, a `AwsS3Bucket` connection is required. For example:
      ```yaml
        connections:
        - id: files
          type: AwsS3Bucket
          properties:
            accessKeyId:
              _secret: FILES_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            secretAccessKey:
              _secret: FILES_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            region: af-south-1
            bucket:
              _secret: FILES_S3_BUCKET
            write: true
      ````

      > The examples on this page is not setup with a [`AwsS3Bucket`](/AWSS3) connection, and thus will throw.
