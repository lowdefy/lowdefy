            AWS S3 is a file or data storage solution, provided by Amazon Web Services. S3 does not work like a traditional file system, data is stored as objects in a collection of objects called a bucket.
            Objects can be read from S3 and stored in S3 using web requests. These objects can be public or private. You can read more [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html).

            Lowdefy integrates with AWS S3 using presigned links. These are links that are authorized to give access to private objects, or that allow you to create new objects, and that expire after a certain amount of time. This allows you to upload or download directly from S3 from the browser.

            A guide to creating and connecting to an S3 bucket is given at the bottom of this page.

            ## Connections

            Connection types:
              - AwsS3Bucket

            ### AwsS3Bucket

            The `AwsS3Bucket` connection is used to connect to a AWS S3 bucket. AWS S3 is the file storage solution provided by Amazon Web services.

            #### Properties
            - `accessKeyId`: _String_ - AWS IAM access key id with s3 access.
            - `secretAccessKey`: _String_ - AWS IAM secret access key with s3 access.
            - `region`: _String_ - AWS region bucket is located in.
            - `bucket`: _String_ - S3 bucket name.
            - `read`: _Boolean_ - Allow reads from the bucket. Default `true`.
            - `write`: _Boolean_ - Allow writes to the bucket. Default `false`.

            ### Examples

            Read and writes on a bucket:
            ```yaml
            connections:
              - id: my_bucket
                type: AwsS3Bucket
                properties:
                  accessKeyId:
                    _secret: my_bucket_access_key_id
                  secretAccessKey:
                    _secret: my_bucket_secret_access_key
                  region: eu-west-1
                  bucket: my-bucket-name
                  write: true
            ```

            ## Requests

            Request types:
              - AwsS3PresignedGetObject
              - AwsS3PresignedGetObject
              - AwsS3PresignedPostPolicy

            ### AwsS3PresignedGetObject

            The `AwsS3PresignedGetObject` request is used to get a download link for an object in AWS S3. The link provided by this request can be opened using the `Link` action.

            #### Properties
            - `versionId`: _String_ - VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.
            - `expires`: _Number_ - Number of seconds for which the policy should be valid.
            - `key`: _String_ - Key (or filename) under which object will be stored. If another file is saved with the same key, that file will be overwritten, so a random string in this field is probably needed.
            - `responseContentType`: _String_ - Sets the Content-Type header of the response.
            - `responseContentDisposition`: _String_ - Sets the Content-Disposition header of the response.

            ### Examples

            Download a pdf and open in a new tab:
            ```yaml
            requests:
              - id: my_file_link
                type: AwsS3PresignedGetObject
                connectionId: my_bucket_connection
                properties:
                  key: pdf-filename-as4dacd.pdf
                  responseContentType: application/pdf

                    ...
                    blocks:
                      - id: getFileButton
                        type: Button
                        actions:
                          onClick:
                            - id: open_file
                              type: Link
                              params:
                                url:
                                  _request: my_file_link
                                newWindow: true
            ```

            ### AwsS3PresignedPostPolicy

            The `AwsS3PresignedPostPolicy` request is used to create a policy that allows a file to be uploaded to AWS S3. This is used by a block like the `S3Uploadbutton` to upload a file.

            #### Properties
            - `acl`: _String_ - Access control lists used to grant read and write access.
              -- private
              -- public-read
              -- public-read-write
              -- aws-exec-read
              -- authenticated-read
              -- bucket-owner-read
              -- bucket-owner-full-control
            - `conditions`: _Array_ of _Array_- Conditions to be enforced on the request.
            - `expires`: _Number_ - Number of seconds for which the policy should be valid.
            - `key`: _String_ - Key (or filename) under which object will be stored. If another file is saved with the same key, that file will be overwritten, so a random string in this field is probably needed.


            ### Examples

            Upload a file with user filename and random id:
            ```yaml
            - id: my_post_policy
              type: AwsS3PresignedPostPolicy
              connectionId: my_bucket_connection
              properties:
                key:
                  _nunjucks:
                    template: uploads/{{filename}}-{{uid}}
                    on:
                      filename:
                        _args: filename
                      uid:
                        _args: filename
            ```

            ## Creating a bucket

            ###### Step 1 - Create an AWS account

            Go to the [AWS homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/) and create an account if you don't already have one. you can find more information [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).

            ###### Step 2 - Create an S3 bucket

            1. Once logged in, search for S3 in the search box.
            2. Click 'Create Bucket'
            3. Choose a name and AWS region for your bucket
            4. Continue creating the bucket with any extra settings is needed.
            5. Make sure the 'Block all public access' box is ticked if you don't want to allow public access.
            6. Click 'Create Bucket'

            ###### Step 3 - Set the CORS settings for your bucket

            CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a security feature that is used to restrict web applications from accessing resources from different origins, or domain names. To allow your Lowdefy app to access the contents of the bucket, you need to add a CORS rule on the bucket that authorizes your app

            1. Click on you bucket.
            2. Click on the 'Permissions' tab.
            3. Click on the 'CORS Configuration' tab.
            4. Paste this configuration and save (Fill in your own Lowdefy domain name).

            ```json
            [
                {
                    "AllowedHeaders": [
                        "*"
                    ],
                    "AllowedMethods": [
                        "*"
                    ],
                    "AllowedOrigins": [
                        "https://YOUR_LOWDEFY_DOMAIN_HERE"
                    ],
                    "ExposeHeaders": []
                },
            ]
            ```

            ###### Step 4 - Create an IAM user

            IAM is the AWS identity and access management system. This can be used to give very granular access permissions. We will create a programmatic user that has the rights to read and write objects in the Bucket.

            1. In the 'Services' dropdown in the header, search for 'IAM'.
            2. Click on 'Users' in the menu on the left.
            3. Click 'Add User'
            4. Choose a descriptive name for the user.
            5. Choose programmatic access and click next.
            6. Choose 'Attach existing policies directly'.
            7. Choose 'Create Policy'.
            8. Choose the JSON tab and paste the following (Fill in your own bucket name):
            ```JSON
            {
                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                "Statement": [
                    {
                        "Sid": "ListObjectsInBucket",
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
                        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME_HERE"]
                    },
                    {
                        "Sid": "AllObjectActions",
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Action": "s3:*Object",
                        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME_HERE/*"]
                    }
                ]
            }
            ```

            9. Choose review policy and save.
            10. In your previous tab, refresh and search for the policy you just created. Attach it to the user.
            11. Click next, review and create the user.
            12. Set the access key id and secret access key in your Lowdefy secrets store.
