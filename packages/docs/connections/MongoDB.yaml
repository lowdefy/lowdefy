            MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores JSON-like documents. These documents are stored in collections, which are like database tables. The fields inside these document can differ from document to document, but generally they are all more or less the same. However documents with different schemas can be stored in the same collection.

            ##### ObjectIds

            MongoDB uses the _id field as the id for a document. This has to be unique for every document in the collection. If no _id is provided when the document is created, a MongoDB [ObjectId](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/) is created for that document. This id includes a timestamp, a random element and an incrementing counter, to ensure it is unique even if multiple ids are created at the same time.

            The _id is often represented as:

            ```js
            {
              _id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011")
            }
            ```

            To be able to transmit these ids over JSON network connections, and to use them in Lowdefy apps, Lowdefy serializes these ids as (in YAML):
            ```yaml
            _id:
              _oid: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
            ```

            Ids specified in this way will be treated as ObjectIds by MongoDB requests and mutations.


            ## Connections

            Connection types:
              - MongoDBCollection

            ### MongoDBCollection

            The `MongoDBCollection` connection sets up a connection to a MongoDB deployment. A [connection URI](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/index.html) with authentication credentials (username and password) is required. The URI can be in the standard or dns seedlist (srv) formats. Connections are defined on a collection level, since this allows for read/write access control on a per collection level. Access control can also be managed using the roles in the database.

            >Since the connection URI contains authentication secrets, it should be stored using the [`_secret`](operators/secret.md) operator.

            When using MongoDBUpdateOne and MongoDBDeleteOne requests, take note that the responses differ if the connection has a log collection.

            #### Properties
            - `databaseUri: string`: __Required__ - Connection uri string for the MongoDb deployment. Should be stored using the [_secret](operators/secret.md) operator.
            - `databaseName: string`: Default: Database specified in connection string - The name of the database in the MongoDB deployment.
            - `collection: string`: __Required__ - The name of the MongoDB collection.
            - `read: boolean`: Default: `true` - Allow read operations like find on the collection.
            - `write: boolean`: Default: `false` - Allow write operations like update on the collection.
            - `options: object`: See the [driver documentation](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.0/interfaces/mongoclientoptions.html) for more information.

            #### Examples

            ###### MongoDB collection with reads and writes:
            ```yaml
            connections:
              - id: my_collection
                type: MongoDBCollection
                properties:
                  databaseUri:
                    _secret: MONGODB_URI
                  collection: my_collection_name
                  write: true
            ```
            ###### MongoDB collection with reads, writes and a log collection:
            ```yaml
            connections:
              - id: my_collection
                type: MongoDBCollection
                properties:
                  databaseUri:
                    _secret: MONGODB_URI
                  collection: my_collection_name
                  write: true
                  changeLog:
                    collection: log_collection_name
                    meta:
                      user:
                        _user: true
            ```
            Environment variables:
            ```
            LOWDEFY_SECRET_MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://username:password@server.example.com/database
            ```

            ### MongoDBAggregation

            The `MongoDBAggregation` request executes an [aggregation pipeline](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/) in the collection specified in the connectionId. It returns the array of documents returned by the aggregation. Aggregation pipelines are MongoDB's data processing and aggregation framework. They are based on a series of stages, each of which apply a transformation to the data passed through them, like sorting, grouping or calculating additional fields.

            >Cursors are not supported. The request will return the whole body of the response as an array.

            #### Properties
            - `pipeline: object[]`: __Required__ - Array containing all the aggregation framework commands for the execution.
            - `options: object`: Optional settings. See the [driver documentation](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.0/classes/collection.html#aggregate) for more information. Supported settings are:

              - `collation: object`: Specify collation (MongoDB 3.4 or higher) settings for update operation.
              - `comment: string`: Add a [comment](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/comment/index.html) to the aggregation. These comments are visible in the MongoDB profile log, making them easier to interpret.
              - `dbName: string`: The database name.
              - `explain: boolean`: Specifies to return the information on the processing of the pipeline.
              - `fullResponse: boolean`: Return the full server response for the command.
              - `hint: string | object`: Add an index selection hint to an aggregation command.
              - `ignoreUndefined: boolean`: Default: `true` - Serialize will not emit undefined fields.

It requires a filter, which is written in the query syntax, to select a document to update. It will update the first document that matches the filter. If the `upsert` option is set to true, it will insert a new document if no document is found to update.
            > MongoDBUpdateOne response differs when the connection has a log collection. When a log collection is set on the connection, a findOneAndUpdate operation is performed compared to the standard updateOne operation.
