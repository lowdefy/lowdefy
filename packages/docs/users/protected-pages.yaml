            By default, all the pages in a Lowdefy app are public. Protected pages are pages that can only be accessed by a logged in user. If a user that is not logged in tries to access a protected page, the user will be redirected to the 404 page. Pages that a user is not allowed to see will be filtered from the app menus.

            The config can either be set to protect all pages, except for a list of public pages, or vise-versa, all pages are public except for a a list of protected pages.

            Protected and public pages can be configured at the path `config.auth.pages` in the Lowdefy configuration. Here the fields `protected` and `public` fields can be set to true, or a list of pageIds. You cannot set `protected` or `public` to `false`, and both can't be an array or `true`.

            When protecting all pages in the app, you will need to set at least one as public, to allow users to log in to the app.

            #### Examples

            ###### List specific public pages:
            ```yaml
            lowdefy: 3.23.2
            config:
              auth:
                pages:
                  protected: true
                  public:
                    - '404'
                    - login
                    - public-page
            ````
            ###### List specific protected pages:
            ```yaml
            lowdefy: 3.23.2
            config:
              auth:
                pages:
                  public: true
                  protected:
                    - admin
                    - users
            ````
