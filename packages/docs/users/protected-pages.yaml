                By default, all the pages in a Lowdefy app are public. Protected pages are pages that can only be accessed by a logged in user. If a user that is not logged in tries to access a protected page, the user will be redirected to the 404 page. Pages that a user are not allowed to see will be filtered from the app menus.

                The config can either be set to protect all pages, except for a list of public pages, or vice-versa, all pages are public except for a a list of protected pages.

                Protected and public pages can be configured in the `auth.pages` section of the Lowdefy configuration. Here the fields `protected` and `public` fields can be set to true, or a list of pageIds. You cannot set `protected` or `public` to `false`, and both can't be an array or `true`.

                When protecting all pages in the app, you will need to set at least one page as public, to allow users to log in to the app.

                The 404 page (used to indicate that a requested page cannot be found) is always a public page. A default 404 page will be created if you do not specify one, but if you create a page with pageId `'404'` then that page will be the 404 page.

                ## Examples

                ###### List specific public pages:
                ```yaml
                lowdefy: {{ version }}
                auth:
                  pages:
                    protected: true
                    public:
                      - '404'
                      - login
                      - public-page
                ````
                ###### List specific protected pages:
                ```yaml
                lowdefy: {{ version }}
                auth:
                  pages:
                    public: true
                    protected:
                      - admin
                      - users
                ````
