            The [`Login`](/Login) and [`Logout`](/Logout) actions can be used to log users in and out.

            ## Login

            The `Login` action requests the OpenID provider's authorization URL from the Lowdefy server. The user is redirected to this URL, which normally hosts a login page. After the user has logged in successfully, the user is redirected to the `auth/openid-callback` route in the Lowdefy app, where the rest of the OpenID authorization code flow is completed.

            The parameters of the Login action specify where the user is redirected after login is complete. If the pageId is not set, the user is redirected to the homepage. The parameters are:
            - `authUrlQueryParams: object`: Query parameters to set for the authorization URL.
            - `pageId: string`: The pageId of the page to redirect to after the login flow is complete
            - `input: object`: The input to set for the page the user is redirected to after login.
            - `urlQuery: object`: The urlQuery to set for the page the user is redirected to after login.

            #### Examples

            ###### A login page that redirects users in the onEnter event:
            ```yaml
            id: login
            type: Context
            events:
              onEnter:
                # Redirect to "page1" if user is already logged in.
                - id: logged_in_redirect
                  type: Link
                  skip:
                    _eq:
                      - _user: sub
                      - null
                  params: page1
                # Call the Login action to log the user in.
                - id: login
                  type: Login
                  skip:
                    _ne:
                      - _user: sub
                      - null
                  params:
                    # Redirect to "page1" after login is complete.
                    pageId: page1
            ```

            ###### A set of login and logout buttons:
            ```yaml
            id: login_logout
            type: Box
            blocks:
              - id: Login
                type: Button
                visible:
                  _eq:
                    - _user: sub
                    - null
                events:
                  onClick:
                    - id: login
                      type: Login
              - id: Logout
                type: Button
                visible:
                  _ne:
                    - _user: sub
                    - null
                events:
                  onClick:
                    - id: logout
                      type: Logout
            ```

            ###### A signup button that uses authUrlQueryParams to request the signup screen:
            ```yaml
            id: Signup
            type: Button
            events:
              onClick:
                - id: login
                  type: Login
                  params:
                    authUrlQueryParams:
                      screen_hint: signup
            ```

            ## Logout

            When the `Logout` action is called, the user data and authorization cookie are cleared by the app. The `Logout` action does not take any parameters. The user is then redirected to the URL configured in `logoutRedirectUri`, or the app homepage if this is not configured.

            Some OpenID Connect providers provide a URL that the user can be directed to to logout the user from the the provider. These urls normally have a query parameter that specifies where the provider should redirect the user after they have logged out the user. These redirect URLs are normally configured with the provider.

            The logoutRedirectUri can be a [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) template string, with the following template variables:
            - `client_id`: The OpenID Connect client ID in `LOWDEFY_SECRET_OPENID_CLIENT_ID`
            - `host`: The app host URL. This url includes the URL prefix (`https://` or `http://` if running a development server), and is URI encoded. It is intended to be used as a query parameter.
            - `id_token_hint`: The user idToken.
            - `openid_domain`: The OpenID Connect client ID in `LOWDEFY_SECRET_OPENID_DOMAIN`.

            #### Examples

            ###### Redirect to the `logged-out` page in the app after logout:
            ```yaml
            config:
              auth:
                openId:
                  logoutRedirectUri: '/logged-out'
            ```

            ###### Redirect to the Auth0 logout URL and return to the `logged-out` page in the app after logout:
            ```yaml
            config:
              auth:
                openId:
                  # Line breaks added for clarity
                  logoutRedirectUri: "{{ openid_domain }}/v2/logout?\
                    returnTo={{ host }}/logged-out&\
                    client_id={{ client_id }}"
            ```

            ###### Redirect to the Keycloak logout URL and return to the `logged-out` page in the app after logout:
            ```yaml
            config:
              auth:
                openId:
                  # Line breaks added for clarity
                  logoutRedirectUri: "{{ openid_domain }}/protocol/openid-connect/logout?\
                    post_logout_redirect_uri={{ host }}/logged-out&\
                    client_id={{ client_id }}&\
                    id_token_hint={{ id_token_hint }}"
            ```
