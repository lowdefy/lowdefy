            The `user` object contains all the claims on the OpenID Connect idToken, except for `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, and `iss`.

            The following claims might be included:
            - `sub`: The user id (Subject).
            - `email`
            - `name`
            - `given_name`
            - `family_name`
            - `picture`: A url to the user's profile picture.
            - `updated_at`
            - `email_verified`

            The user object can be accessed using the [`_user`](/_user) operator.

            #### Examples

            ```yaml
            id: avatar

            properties:
              src:
