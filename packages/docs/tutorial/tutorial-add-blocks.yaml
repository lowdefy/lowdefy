            We would like to add an input form with the following fields:

            - A title for the ticket.
            - The type of ticket. This should be a selection from a list of types.
            - A description of the ticket.

            There should also be submit and reset buttons at the bottom of the page.

            #### Step 1

            Copy the following blocks and add them in the card's blocks array.

            ###### `pages/new-ticket.yaml`
            ```yaml
            id: new-ticket
                # ...
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                # ...
                blocks:
                  - id: page_heading
                    type: Title
                    properties:
                      content: Log a ticket # Change the title on the page.
                      level: 3 # Make the title a little smaller (an html `<h3>`).
            ################ ------- Copy from here -------- ################
                  - id: ticket_title
                    type: TextInput
                    properties:
                      title: Title
                  - id: ticket_type
                    type: ButtonSelector
                    properties:
                      title: Ticket type
                      options: # Set the allowed options
                        - Feature request
                        - Bug report
                        - Question
                  - id: ticket_description
                    type: TextArea
                    properties:
                      title: Description
                  - id: reset_button
                    type: Button
                    layout:
                      span: 12 # Set the size of the button (span 12 of 24 columns)
                    properties:
                      title: Reset
                      block: true # Make the button fill all the space available to it
                      type: default # Make the button a plain button
                      icon: ClearOutlined
                  - id: submit_button
                    type: Button
                    layout:
                      span: 12
                    properties:
                      title: Submit
                      block: true
                      type: primary # Make the button a primary button with color
                      icon: SaveOutlined
            ################ -------- Copy to here ---------- ################
            ```

            >  If you would like to see how your config should look at this point, you can find it [here](/tutorial-add-blocks-config).

            #### Step 2

            Your booking page should something like this:
      - id: example1
        type: PageHeaderMenu
        layout:
          contentJustify: center
        properties:
          style:
            minHeight: 300px
          menu:
            links: []
        blocks:
          - id: content_card
            type: Card
            layout:
              contentGutter: 16
              size: 600
            blocks:
              - id: page_heading
                type: Title
                properties:
                  content: Log a ticket
                  level: 3
              - id: ticket_title
                type: TextInput
                properties:
                  title: Title
              - id: ticket_type
                type: ButtonSelector
                properties:
                  title: Ticket type
                  options:
                    - Feature request
                    - Bug report
                    - Question
              - id: ticket_description
                type: TextArea
                properties:
                  title: Description
              - id: reset_button
                type: Button
                layout:
                  span: 12
                properties:
                  title: Reset
                  block: true
                  type: default
                  icon: ClearOutlined
              - id: submit_button
                type: Button
                layout:
                  span: 12
                properties:
                  title: Submit
                  block: true
                  type: primary
                  icon: SaveOutlined

            ### What happened

            We added 3 form input blocks to the page. For each of those blocks, we set the `title` property, and for the ticket type selector we set a list of ticket types to the options property.

            We also added reset button and submit button. We set a few more properties on the buttons to set their layout and appearance.

            ### How it works

            Lowdefy apps are made from blocks. These blocks can be the page layout with header and menu, a piece of text, a chart or table, tabs or even a popup message or icon. You specify which block is rendered with the `type` field. There are 5 block categories, namely display, input, container, list, and context.

            The first block on a page needs to be a [context](/context-and-state) block. For now, it is enough to understand that this context allows the Lowdefy magic to happen.

            All blocks need to have an `id` that identifies the block. This id should be unique in that block's context.

            ### Up next

            Currently our form doesn't do very much. In the next section we will use [actions](/events-and-actions) and [operators](/operators) to make it more interactive.
