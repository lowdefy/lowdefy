                Let's create a page for a web form where users can log a new ticket.

                #### 2.1. Create `new-ticket.yaml`

                Create a new YAML file in the project directory (the same directory as the `lowdefy.yaml` file) called `new-ticket.yaml`, with the following content:

                ```yaml
                id: new-ticket
                type: PageHeaderMenu
                properties:
                  title: New ticket # The title in the browser tab.
                layout:
                  contentJustify: center # Center the contents of the page.
                blocks:
                  - id: content_card
                    type: Card
                    layout:
                      size: 800 # Set the size of the card so it does not fill the full screen.
                      contentGutter: 16 # Make a 16px gap between all blocks in this card.
                    blocks:
                      - id: page_heading
                        type: Title
                        properties:
                          content: Log a ticket # Change the title on the page.
                          level: 3 # Make the title a little smaller (an html `<h3>`).
                ```

                #### 2.2. Update `lowdefy.yaml`

                Change the `lowdefy.yaml` to look like this:

                ```yaml
                name: lowdefy-project-template
                lowdefy: {{ version }}

                pages:
                ################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
                  - _ref: new-ticket.yaml
                ################ -------- Copy to here ---------- ################
                  - id: welcome
                    type: PageHeaderMenu
                    properties:
                      title: Welcome
                    # ...
                ```

      - id: warning_indent
        type: Alert
        properties:
          type: warning
          icon: AiFillWarning
          message: Indentation is important
          description: YAML files use indentation to determine the data structure represented. If you are having any problems, make sure the indentation is the same as in the instructions.

      - id: body_view_in_browser
        type: Markdown
        properties:
          content: |
            #### 2.3. Navigate to the new page

            Your browser should reload, and you should see a link in the header menu to the booking page. If you click on that link it should take you to a page that looks like this:

      - id: example1
        type: PageHeaderMenu
        layout:
          contentJustify: center
        properties:
          style:
            minHeight: 300px
          menu:
            links:
              - id: new-ticket
                properties:
                  title: new-ticket
                type: MenuLink
              - id: welcome
                type: MenuLink
                properties:
                  title: welcome

        blocks:
          - id: content_card
            type: Card
            layout:
              size: 600
            blocks:
              - id: page_heading
                type: Title
                properties:
                  content: Log a ticket
                  level: 3

      - id: body_menus
        type: MarkdownWithCode
        properties:
          content: |
            If you click on the link in the menu, you should see that your browser path (the part after `localhost:3000` or `example.com`) changes from `welcome` to `new-ticket`.

            ### What happened

            - We created a new page with id `new-ticket`.
            - We used the [`_ref` operator](/_ref) to reference configuration in another file.
            - That page can now be found at the `/new-ticket` route.
            - A link to that page was created in the menu. These links are in the order of the pages.

            ## Menus

            A menu is created by default from all the pages in your app, in the order that they appear in the pages array. Often more control is needed over the menu. You might want to group menu items into different groups, change the title, exclude a page or add an icon. To do this, we can define a menu in the `menus` section of the `lowdefy.yaml` file.

            #### 2.4 - Add the menu configuration

            Copy the following and add it to your `lowdefy.yaml` file just before the pages section:

            ```yaml
            ################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
            menus:
              - id: default
                links:
                  - id: new-ticket
                    type: MenuLink
                    properties:
                      icon: AiOutlineAlert
                      title: New ticket
                    pageId: new-ticket
                  - id: welcome
                    type: MenuLink
                    properties:
                      icon: AiOutlineHome
                      title: Home
                    pageId: welcome
            ################ -------- Copy to here ---------- ################
            pages:
              - _ref: new-ticket.yaml
                # ...
            ```

            The menu links will now have icons and titles.

            > If you would like to see how your config should look at this point, you can find it [here](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy-example-tutorial/tree/main/02-creating-a-page).

            ### Up next

            In the next section we will add some more blocks to our page to create a form to capture the ticket data.

      - _ref:
          path: templates/navigation_buttons.yaml
          vars:
            previous_page_title: Getting started
            previous_page_id: tutorial-start
            next_page_title: Adding blocks
            next_page_id: tutorial-add-blocks
