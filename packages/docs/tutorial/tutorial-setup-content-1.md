In this tutorial we will be creating a simple ticketing app, that allow users to file new tickets, and see a list of outstanding tickets. We will be hosting this app with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

### Requirements

You will need to have the following:

- A Github account. You can create one [here](https://github.com/join).
- A Netlify account. You can create one [here](https://app.netlify.com/signup). It is easiest if you sign up with your Github account.

- Give your project a name and create your project repository.

#### Step 2

Link your Github project to Netlify.

- Once logged in to Netlify, click the "New site from git" button.
