            We will be saving the data from our form in a Google Sheet, using the [`GoogleSheet`](/GoogleSheet) connection. To do this, we will first need to set up a Google Cloud Platform project to get credentials to access the API.

            ### Creating a Google Sheet and getting credentials

            #### Step 5.1

            Go to [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets) and create a new Google Sheet.

            #### Step 5.2

            Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and sign in.

            #### Step 5.3

            Click on the "Select a project" dropdown at the top left, and then choose "NEW PROJECT". Give your project a name and click "Create".

            #### Step 5.4

            Go to the "APIs and Services" section, and the click "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" button.

            #### Step 5.5

            Search for "Sheets" and select the Google Sheets API.

            #### Step 5.6

            Click "Enable".

            #### Step 5.7

            Click "CREATE CREDENTIALS".

            #### Step 5.8

            Choose the following:
            - **Which API are you using?**: Google Sheets API
            - **Where will you be calling the API from?** : Web server (e.g. node.js, Tomcat)
            - **What data will you be accessing?**: Application data
            - **Are you planning to use this API with App Engine or Compute Engine?**: No, I'm not using them

            Then click "What credentials do I need?"

            #### Step 5.9

            Choose the following:
            - Give the account a name.
            - Chose "Project > Editor" as the role.
            - Choose JSON as the key type.

            Click continue.

            #### Step 5.10

            You will be asked to save a file. This file contains the credentials to access your sheet, so make sure to handle it securely. Download the file. Do not commit it to source control.

            #### Step 5.11

            In the next section we will be deploying our app using Netlify. To use the private key on Netlify, we need to base64 encode it, since the new-line characters cause problems when used in an environment variable.

            You can use the converter below to convert your key. This will output a long stream of characters that are your encoded key.

            > The base64 conversion happens on the web client. We won't store your key. You can look at how the key is encoded [here](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy/blob/main/packages/docs/tutorial/tutorial-requests.yaml) or convert your key in the browser console using [btoa()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/btoa).

            #### Step 5.12

            Create a file called `.env` in your project directory with the following:

            ##### `.env`
            ```
            LOWDEFY_SECRET_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL=__YOUR_CLIENT_EMAIL__
            LOWDEFY_SECRET_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY=__YOUR_ENCODED_PRIVATE_KEY__
            ```

            Fill in the client email from the credentials file and your encoded private key values (without quotes). This will give the development server access to these secrets.

      - id: warning_dont_commit
        type: Alert
        properties:
          type: warning
          icon: AiFillWarning
          description: The .env file contains your credentials. Do not commit this file to git. It should be listed in your .gitignore file if you used the CLI init command.

      - id: body_use_connection
        type: MarkdownWithCode
        properties:
          content: |
            #### Step 5.13

            Because we changed the environment variables, we need to restart the dev server. Run `npx lowdefy@latest dev` again to restart the server.

            #### Step 5.14

            We need to give our service account access to our Google Sheet. Go to your Google Sheet and click the "Share" button. Share the sheet with the client email of the service account we just created, with the "Editor" role.

            ### What happened

            We created a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, and created a service account in that project that we can use to access Google sheets. This gave us the credentials we need for the [`GoogleSheet`](/GoogleSheet) connection.

            We set up these credentials for our local dev environment using a `.env` file. The `.env` file sets [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) in the process the server is running in.

            Because we set environment variables that start with `LOWDEFY_SECRET_`, these values become part of the [`secrets`](/Secrets) object, and can be accessed using the [`_secret`](/_secret) operator.

            ### Using the Google Sheets connection

            #### Step 5.15

            To use a Google Sheet with the Lowdefy connection, we first need to define the columns in the sheet. This will be the same fields as the data we will be saving later.

            In the first row of your sheet, add the following column headers:

            - ticket_title
            - ticket_type
            - ticket_description
            - confirm_restart
            - created_date

            #### Step 5.16

            In your `lowdefy.yaml` file, add the following:

            ##### `lowdefy.yaml`

            ```yaml
            name: lowdefy-project-template
            version: CURRENT_LOWDEFY_VERSION

            ################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
            connections:
              - id: google_sheet
                type: GoogleSheet
                properties:
                  client_email:
                    _secret: SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL
                  private_key:
                    _base64.decode:
                      _secret: SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY
                  sheetIndex: 0
                  spreadsheetId: __YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID__
                  write: true
            ################ ------- Copy to here ----------- ################

            menus:
              # ...
            ```

            #### Step 5.17

            Note down your spreadsheetId. You can find this by looking at the url in your browser when you are looking at your sheet. It should look something like:

            `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{spreadsheetId}/edit#gid=0`

            where the spreadsheetId is a 44 character random string. Fill in your spreadsheetId in the spreadsheet connection.

            #### Step 5.18

            In your `new-ticket.yaml` file, add the following request:

            ##### `pages/new-ticket.yaml`

            ```yaml
            id: new-ticket
            type: PageHeaderMenu
            ################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
            requests:
              - id: save_data
                type: GoogleSheetAppendOne
                connectionId: google_sheet
                properties:
                  row:
                    # Get all the values to save from state
                    ticket_title:
                      _state: ticket_title
                    ticket_type:
                      _state: ticket_type
                    ticket_description:
                      _state: ticket_description
                    confirm_restart:
                      _state: confirm_restart
                    # Add the date the row was created using the `_date.now` operator.
                    created_date:
                      _date: now
            ################ ------- Copy to here ----------- ################

            properties:
              title: New ticket # The title in the browser tab.
            layout:
              contentJustify: center # Center the contents of the page
            blocks:
              # ...
            ```

            #### Step 5.19

            In your `new-ticket.yaml` file, add the following action to the submit button:

            ##### `pages/new-ticket.yaml`

            ```yaml
            id: new-ticket
            # ...
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                # ...
                blocks:
                  - id: page_heading
                    # ...
                    # ...
                    # ...
                  - id: submit_button
                    type: Button
                    #...
                    events:
                      onClick:
                        - id: validate
                          type: Validate
                        ################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
                        - id: save_data # Make a request to Google Sheets
                          type: Request
                          params: save_data
                        - id: reset # Reset the form once data has been submitted
                          type: Reset
                        ################ ------- Copy to here ----------- ################
            ```

            #### Step 5.20

            If you click the submit button, you should see your data submitted to your Google Sheet.

            ### What happened

            We set up the column names we will be using in our Google Sheet. We need to do this to use the `GoogleSheet` connection.

            We defined the `GoogleSheet` connection we will be using in our app, using the credentials we obtained earlier.

            We also defined a `GoogleSheetAppendOne` request, to save the data to our sheet, and called that request when clicking the submit button.

            > You can find the final configuration files for this section [here](tutorial-requests-config).

            ### Up next

            Up next we will be deploying our app using Netlify. Then it will be live, on the internet, for anyone to see 🚀.
