            References and templates have the following use cases:
            - Splitting out the config for readability and code navigation.
            - Splitting out a piece of config in order to use the exact same config in multiple places.
            - Using a reference with variables to make use of a shared piece of config with dynamic variables.
            - Using a `.njk` file to create config files using the Nunjucks templating language.
            - Using resolver and transformer functions to create Lowdefy config using Javascript functions.

            ## Using References to Improve Readability

            References are made using the [`_ref`](/_ref) operator. If the referenced file has a `.yaml` or `.json` extension, the contents of the file will be parsed, else the file content is included as a string (this is useful for `.md` or `.html` files). As an example of splitting an app into logically distinct files, references can be used to write each page as a separate file:

            ###### lowdefy.yaml
            ```yaml
            lowdefy: LOWDEFY_VERSION

            pages:
              _ref: pages/page1.yaml # Path to the referenced file. Always from the root of the project.
              _ref: pages/page1.yaml
            ```

            ## Using References as Templates for Improved Reusability

            The `_ref` operator can take an argument called `vars`. This can be any data, and is passed down to later be accessed with the [`_var`](/_var) operator. By using vars, the referenced file can become a template, using the given variables. For example, a standard page template might be used for multiple pages in an app:

            ###### pages/page1.yaml
            ```yaml
            _ref:
              path: templates/text_page.yaml
              vars:
                id: page1
                title: Page 1
                content:
                  _ref: markdowns/content.md
            ```

            ###### markdowns/content.md
            ```yaml
            Page content text.
            ```

            ###### templates/text_page.yaml
            ```yaml
            id:
              _var: id
            type: PageHeaderMenu
            properties:
              title:
                _var: title
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                type: Card
                blocks:
                  - id: title
                    type: Title
                    properties:
                      content:
                        _var: title
                  - id: content
                    type: Markdown
                    properties:
                      content:
                        _var: content
            ```

            ## Nunjucks Templating

            Templating can be taken further by referencing [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) template files. If a file ends with the `.njk` file extension, the file will first be hydrated as a Nunjucks template, using the `vars` as template variables. If the file ends with `.yaml.njk` or `.json.njk`, the output of the template will then be parsed. Nunjucks templates are useful since the template file does not need to be valid yaml before it is hydrated, and features like for-loops and if-statements can be used.

            Templating is used extensively to create the Lowdefy docs (these docs are a Lowdefy app). You can look at how they are used [here](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy/tree/main/packages/docs).

            We can modify the example above to make use of nunjucks templating to allow us to add subsections to our page. This can be done as follows:

            ###### pages/page1.yaml
            ```yaml
            _ref:
              path: templates/text_page.yaml.njk
              vars:
                id: page1
                title: Page 1
                content:
                  _ref: markdowns/content.md
                subsections:
                  - id: subsection1
                    title: Subsection 1
                    content: |
                      Subsection 1 content text.
                  - id: subsection2
                    title: Subsection 2
                    content: |
                      Subsection 2 content text.
            ```

            ###### markdowns/content.md
            ```yaml
            Page content text.
            ```

            ###### templates/text_page.yaml.njk
            ```yaml
            id:
              _var: id
            type: PageHeaderMenu
            properties:
              title:
                _var: title
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                type: Card
                blocks:
                  - id: title
                    type: Title
                    properties:
                      content:
                        _var: title
                  - id: content
                    type: Markdown
                    properties:
                      content:
                        _var: content
                  {% if subsections %}
                  {% for subsection in subsections %}
                  - id: {{ subsection.id }}_title
                    type: Title
                    properties:
                      content: {{ subsection.title }}
                  - id: {{ subsection.id }}_content
                    type: Markdown
                    properties:
                      content: {{ subsection.content }}
                  {% endfor %}
                  {% endif %}
            ```

            ## Custom JavaScript Functions

            The `_ref` operator can also be extended with custom JavaScript functions. A `resolver` function can be specified, which can overwrite the default way configuration files are read from the filesystem. A `transformer` function can be used to transform the value returned by the `_ref` operator.

            ### Resolver

            This resolver function will first look for the configuration file in the current working directory, but if the file is not found it will be read from an adjacent "shared" directory. This pattern can be used to build apps that mostly use a shared configuration, with a few components that are customised per app.

            ###### resolvers/useLocalOrSharedConfig.js
            ```js
            const fs = require('fs');
            const path = require('path');
            const { promisify } = require('util');

            const readFilePromise = promisify(fs.readFile);

            async function useLocalOrSharedConfig(refPath, vars, context) {
              let fileContent
              try {
                fileContent =  await readFilePromise(path.resolve(refPath), 'utf8');
                return fileContent;
              } catch (error) {
                if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {
                  fileContent = readFilePromise(path.resolve('../shared', refPath), 'utf8');
                  return fileContent;
                }
                throw error;
              }


            }

            module.exports = useLocalOrSharedConfig;
            ```

            ###### lowdefy.yaml
            ```yaml
            lowdefy: LOWDEFY_VERSION

            cli:
              refResolver: resolvers/useLocalOrSharedConfig.js

            pages:
              - _ref: pages/local-page.yaml
              - _ref: pages/shared-page.yaml
            ```

            ### Transformer

            This transformer adds a standard footer to each page:

            ###### transformers/addFooter.js
            ```js
            function addFooter(page, vars) {
              const footer = {
                // ...
              };
              page.areas.footer = footer;
              return page;
            }
            module.exports = addFooter;
            ```

            ###### lowdefy.yaml
            ```yaml
            lowdefy: LOWDEFY_VERSION

            pages:
              - _ref:
                  path: pages/page1.yaml
                  transformer: transformers/addFooter.js
            ```
      - _ref:
          path: templates/navigation_buttons.yaml
          vars:
            previous_page_title: Page and App State
            previous_page_id: page-and-app-state
            next_page_title: Menus
            next_page_id: menus
