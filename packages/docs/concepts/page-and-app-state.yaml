                A Lowdefy app has a few different data objects which can be accessed and modified. The app wide objects are the `global`, `media` and `user` objects. Then there are page specific objects like the `state`, `urlQuery` and `input` objects.

                ## State

                Each page in a Lowdefy app has a `state` object which serves as the general data store for that page.

                Every [`input` category block](/blocks) inside the page will have a value in the `state` object, with their `id` as the key in the `state` object. If the block is not visible the input value is removed from the state object.

                The [`_state`](/_state) operator can be used to read from `state` and the [`SetState`](/SetState) action can be used to modify or add new values in `state` object in the same page from which `SetState` is called.

                > See [`operators`](/operators) and [`events-and-actions`](/events-and-actions) for more details.

                Page states remain even as users navigate to new pages - so if a user returns to a page, the state as they left it will remain.

                ### Reading from state
                Here is an example showing how to read `input` block values from `state`:
                ```yaml
                id: my-page
                type: PageHeaderMenu
                blocks:
                  - id: Name
                    type: TextInput
                  - id: Age
                    type: NumberInput
                  - id: MyDisplay
                    type: Html
                    properties:
                      html:
                        _string.concat:
                          - <b>Name:</b>
                          - _state: Name
                          - <br/><b>Age:</b>
                          - _state: Age
                ```

                ### Modifying state
                The following examples demonstrates how to modify `state`:
                ```yaml
                id: my-page
                type: PageHeaderMenu
                blocks:
                  - id: Name
                    type: TextInput
                  - id: Age
                    type: NumberInput
                  - id: Button
                    type: Button
                    events:
                      onClick:
                        - id: set_person_object
                          type: SetState
                          params:
                            person:
                              name:
                                _state: Name
                              age:
                                _state: Age
                              example: true
                ```

                This will result in a `state` which looks like:
                ```json5
                {
                  "Name": "Alice", // The TextInput value
                  "Age": 99, //The NumberInput value
                  "person": {
                    "name": "Alice",
                    "age": 99,
                    "example": true
                  }
                }
                ```

                ## Global
                The `global` object is a single app level data object defined in the Lowdefy [config root](/lowdefy-schema). This object is the same for every page. The `global` object can be modified using the [`SetGlobal`](/SetGlobal) action.

                > Note that when `SetGlobal` is called, `global` will not be consistent between clients, like different users, or a single user with multiple tabs open.

                ### Reading from global
                This example shows how you can create and read from `global`:

                `lowdefy.yaml`
                ```yaml
                lowdefy: {{ version }}
                global:
                  key: value
                pages:
                  - id: my-page
                    type: PageSiderMenu
                    blocks:
                      id: DisplayGlobalKey
                      type: Html
                      html:
                        _global: key ## Returns 'value'
                ```

                ### Modifying global
                The following examples shows how to modify the `global` object:

                `lowdefy.yaml`
                ```yaml
                lowdefy: {{ version }}
                global:
                  key: value
                pages:
                  - id: my-page
                    type: PageSiderMenu
                    blocks:
                      - id: DisplayGlobalKey
                        type: Html
                        html:
                          _global: key ## Returns `value`
                      - id: ModifyGlobal
                        type: Button
                        events:
                          onClick:
                            - id: modify_global_key
                              type: SetGlobal
                              params:
                                key: New Value
                      - id: DisplayModifiedGlobalKey
                        type: Html
                        html:
                          _global: key ## Returns `New Value`
                ```
                ## URL query
                The `urlQuery` object is used to access variables set in the URL. URL query parameters can be set using the `urlQuery` field in the [`Link`](/Link) action and read using the [`_url_query`](/_url_query) operator. It can be useful to create sharable links containing some additional information other than the page route. For example setting a document id in the url so that the document can be retrieved when the link is opened during the page [`onMount`](/events-and-actions) event.

                > Note that any variables set to `urlQuery` will be visible to users of the app.

                ### Example using `urlQuery` and `Link`

                `first-page.yaml`
                ```yaml
                id: first-page
                type: PageSiderMenu
                blocks:
                  - id: LinkButton
                    type: Button
                    events:
                      - id: link_to_second_page
                        type: Link
                        params:
                          pageId: second-page
                          urlQuery:
                            document-id: ABC123
                ```

                `second-page.yaml`
                ```yaml
                id: second-page
                type: PageSiderMenu
                events:
                  onMount:
                    - id: set_url_id
                      type: SetState
                      params:
                        myDocId:
                          _url_query: document-id ## Returns 'ABC123'
                ```

                ## Input

                The `input` object is unique to a page, and works similar to the `urlQuery` object. The `input` object is used to pass information between page transitions. Variables set to the `input` object are not written to the URL, so they are not visible to app users but also cannot be used to share the data in a link since a `input` object is only consistent between one page and the next to which it links. A `input` object is set using the `input` param of the [`Link`](/Link) action or the `input` property of an [`Anchor`](/Anchor) block when linking from a page to another page in the app and can be read using the [`_input`](/_input) operator.

                > Note `input` cannot be passed between pages when using the `newTab: true` param in the [`Link`](/Link) action.

                ### Example of setting and reading `input`

                `first-page.yaml`
                ```yaml
                id: first-page
                type: PageSiderMenu
                blocks:
                  - id: LinkButton
                    type: Button
                    events:
                      - id: link_to_second_page
                        type: Link
                        params:
                          pageId: second-page
                          input:
                            document-id: 1234
                ```

                `second-page.yaml`
                ```yaml
                id: second-page
                type: PageSiderMenu
                events:
                  onMount:
                    - id: set_input_id
                      type: SetState
                      params:
                        myDocId:
                          _input: document-id ## Returns '1234'
                ```
                ## Media

                The `media` object contains some information about the client screen size, and can be accessed using the [`_media`](/_media) operator. This can be used to add additional responsive logic to a page.

                Here is an example showing how to read the screen size of a smartphone:
                ```yaml
                id: DisplayScreenSize
                type: Html
                properties:
                  html:
                    _media: size ## Returns xs if used on phone width screen width < 576px
                ```

                ## User

                If authentication is configured and a user is logged in, data about the user can be accessed using the [`_user`](/_user) operator. See [User Authentication](/users-introduction) for more details.

                This example shows how to read a logged-in user's username and id:
                ```yaml
                id: my-page
                type: PageSiderMenu
                blocks:
                  - id: DisplayUserName
                    type: Html
                    properties:
                      html:
                        _string.concat:
                          - <b>Name: </b>
                          - _user: name
                  - id: DisplayUserId
                    type: Html
                    properties:
                      html:
                        _string.concat:
                          - <b>ID: </b>
                          - _user: id
                ```

                #### TLDR
                  - There are app wide and page specific data objects.
                  - App wide are `global`, `media` and `user`.
                  - Page specific are `state`, `urlQuery` and `input`.
                  - All input blocks write their value to `state`, with the their `id` as the key in the `state` object.
                  - Input blocks which are not visible are removed from `state`.
                  - The `SetState` action can also modify the `state` object.
