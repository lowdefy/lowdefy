            Lowdefy runs as a single page web app (SPA). It is possible to extend the functionality of a Lowdefy app by loading custom code (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) into the HTML `head` and `body` to of the default `index.html` page.

            The content loaded into the `head` and `body` tag can be any valid HTML, most often `script` tags are loaded to register a new [`JsAction`](/JsAction) or [`_js`](/_js) operator. However, third party code can also be imported, for example Google Analytics, Intercom, etc. Be sure to only load trusted code into your app, as this code will be able to execute JavaScript on all pages of your Lowdefy app, which could expose you app or data to security vulnerabilities.

            > __Warning__: Lowdefy implements the [Ant design](https://ant.design/) UI component framework for app layout and most blocks, thus the default Ant Design CSS is loaded for all Lowdefy apps. Take caution not to unintentionally overwrite existing style settings and classes which can result in a degraded user experience.

            ## Schema to load custom code

            - `app.html.appendHead: string`: Any valid HTML content can be loaded just before the `</head>` tag of the Lowdefy app `index.html` file.
            - `app.html.appendBody: string`: Any valid HTML content can be loaded just before the `</body>` tag of the Lowdefy app `index.html` file.

            Most often it is convenient to abstract this HTML out to a separate file using the [`_ref`](/_ref) operator.

            > __Warning__: Code imported using `appendHead` or `appendBody` will be loaded, and can execute JavaScript on every page of your Lowdefy app.

            ###### Loading third party code snippet like Google Analytics:

            To add [Google Analytics](/https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs) to a Lowdefy app, the `lowdefy.yaml` can be setup with:

            ```yaml
            name: google-analytics-example
            lowdefy: 3.15.0
            # ...
            app:
              html:
                appendHead: |
                  <!-- Google Analytics -->
                  <script>
                  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
                  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
                  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
                  })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

                  ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');
                  ga('send', 'pageview');
                  </script>
                  <!-- End Google Analytics -->
            # ...
            ```

            ## Hosting static files

            A Lowdefy app provides a convenient method to host __public__ files under the `/public/*` app route. Add content to be hosted publicly by creating a folder named `public` in the root of a Lowdefy project folder, next to the `lowdefy.yaml` file. Place the public content in this folder to host this content with your app.

            All content in this folder will be publicly accessible at `{{ APP_URL }}/public/{{ FILE_PATH_NAME }}`. For example, the logo at the top of this page is hosted at [`https://docs.lowdefy.com/public/logo-light-theme.png`](http://localhost:3000/public/logo-light-theme.png). Sub-folders inside the public folder are supported.

            By default, the `public` folder of a Lowdefy app will serve some files which most apps need:
            - `apple-touch-icon.png`: A 180x180px png image file to be used as the apple PWA icon.
            - `icon-32.png`: A 32x32px png image file to be used as fallback favicon for some browsers.
            - `icon-512.png`: A 512x512px png image icon.
            - `icon.svg`: A svg image file which will be used as favicon if supported by browser.
            - `logo-dark-theme.png`: A ~250x72px png image used as the header image for [`PageHeaderMenu`](/PageHeaderMenu) and [`PageSiderMenu`](/PageSiderMenu) blocks on desktop when the block theme is set to `dark`.
            - `logo-light-theme.png`: A ~250x72px png image used as the header image for `PageHeaderMenu` and `PageSiderMenu` blocks on desktop when the block theme is set to `light`.
            - `logo-square-dark-theme.png`: A ~125x125px png image used as the header image for `PageHeaderMenu` and `PageSiderMenu` blocks on mobile when the block theme is set to `dark`.
            - `logo-square-light-theme.png`: A ~125x125px png image used as the header image for `PageHeaderMenu` and `PageSiderMenu` blocks on mobile when the block theme is set to `light`.
            - `manifest.webmanifest`: The app [web manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).

            Any of these files can be overwritten by replacing the file with a modified version. For example, to replace the logo inside the header of `PageSiderMenu` on all pages, add a ~250x72px logo inside the project folder at `/public/logo-light-theme.png`.

            ## Loading and registering a [`JsAction`](/JsAction)

            In order for the Lowdefy app engine to execute a custom JavaScript [action](/events-and-actions), the JavaScript code for the action must be loaded onto the page and registered using the `registerJsAction` method available on the browser [`window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window) object by calling `window.lowdefy.registerJsAction(name: string, action: function)`.

            The `JsAction` allows the use of async functions.

            ###### Load, register and trigger a custom `JsAction` from code in the app `public` folder:

            This example fetches a list of Todos from [{JSON}placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), and updates [state](/context-and-state).

            1) First, add the JavaScript code to the `public` folder and resister the `JsAction`:
            ```js
            // /public/fetchTodos.js
            function async fetchTodos(context, numItems, skip) {
              const data = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos');
              const todos = await data.json();
              return todos.slice(skip, skip + numItems);
            }
            // Register the JsAction for the Lowdefy app to use.
            window.lowdefy.registerJsAction('fetchTodos', fetchTodos);
            ```

            2) Import the JavaScript as a module into the page:
            ```html
            <!-- /header_modules.html -->
            <script type="module" src="/public/fetchTodos.js"></script>
            ```

            3) Set load the custom code into the app header and trigger the action on page load:
            ```yaml
            # /lowdefy.yaml
            name: json-todos
            lowdefy: 3.15.0
            app:
              html:
                appendHead:
                  _ref: header_modules.html # Load the custom HTML into the header.
            pages:
              - id: todos
                type: PageHeaderMenu
                events:
                  onEnter:
                    - id: get_todos
                      type: JsAction
                      params:
                        name: fetchTodos # Trigger the custom JavaScript action.
                        args:
                          - 10   # numItems
                          - 0    # skip
                    - id: set_todos
                      type: SetState
                      params:
                        todos:
                          # Set the response of the get_todos action to state.
                          _actions: get_todos.response
                # ...
            ```

            ## Loading and registering a [`_js`](/_js) operator

            Similar to the loading custom JavaScript actions, custom JavaScript operators can also be loaded. In order for the Lowdefy app engine to execute a custom JavaScript [operator](/operators), the JavaScript code for the operator must be loaded onto the page and registered using the `registerJsOperator` method available on the browser [`window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window) object by calling `window.lowdefy.registerJsOperator(name: string, action: function)`.

            All `_js` functions must be synchronous.

            ###### Load, register and use a custom `_js` operator from code in the app `public` folder:

            This example uses a `_js` operator to remove all duplicates from a list of names.

            1) First, add the JavaScript code to the `public` folder and resister the `_js` operator:
            ```js
            // /public/foo_operators.js
            function removeDuplicates(items) {
              return [ ...new Set(items) ];
            }
            // Register the removeDuplicates function as a _js.deduplicate operator.
            window.lowdefy.registerJsOperator('deduplicate', removeDuplicates);
            ```

            2) Import the JavaScript as a module into the page:
            ```html
            <!-- /header.html -->
            <script type="module" src="/public/foo_operators.js"></script>
            ```

            3) Set load the custom code into the app header and use the new operator on the page:
            ```yaml
            # /lowdefy.yaml
            name: operator-example
            lowdefy: 3.15.0
            app:
              html:
                appendHead:
                  _ref: header.html # Load the custom HTML into the header.
            pages:
              - id: some_names
                type: PageHeaderMenu
                blocks:
                  - id: names
                    type: ButtonSelector
                    properties:
                      title: Select your new friend
                      options:
                      # use the removeDuplicates function and pass a list of names as a function argument
                        _js.deduplicate:
                          - - Anne
                            - Sam
                            - Joe
                            - Micheal
                            - Sam
                            - Steven
                            - Anne
                            - Pepper
                # ...
            ```

            ------

            Custom code provides an easy way to extent the logic functionality of Lowdefy apps. However, to extend the UI capabilities beyond the existing features provided by the default Lowdefy blocks, custom blocks can be loaded onto apps.

      - _ref:
          path: templates/navigation_buttons.yaml
          vars:
            previous_page_title: Lists
            previous_page_id: lists
            next_page_title: Custom Blocks
            next_page_id: custom-blocks
