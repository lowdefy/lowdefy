            ##### TODO: This page needs to be updated.

            Lowdefy runs as a single page web app (SPA). It is possible to extend the functionality of a Lowdefy app by loading custom code (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) into the HTML `head` and `body` to of the default `index.html` page.

            The content loaded into the `head` and `body` tag can be any valid HTML. Third party code can be imported, for example Google Analytics, Intercom, etc. Be sure to only load trusted code into your app, as this code will be able to execute JavaScript on all pages of your Lowdefy app, which could expose you app or data to security vulnerabilities. Your own code can easily be hosted from the [Lowdefy public folder](/hosting-files).

            > __Warning__: Lowdefy implements the [Ant design](https://ant.design/) UI component framework for app layout and most blocks, thus the default Ant Design CSS is loaded for all Lowdefy apps. Take caution not to unintentionally overwrite existing style settings and classes which can result in a degraded user experience.

            ## Schema to load custom code

            - `app.html.appendHead: string`: Any valid HTML content can be loaded just before the `</head>` tag of the Lowdefy app `index.html` file.
            - `app.html.appendBody: string`: Any valid HTML content can be loaded just before the `</body>` tag of the Lowdefy app `index.html` file.

            Most often it is convenient to abstract this HTML out to a separate file using the [`_ref`](/_ref) operator.

            > __Warning__: Code imported using `appendHead` or `appendBody` will be loaded, and can execute JavaScript on every page of your Lowdefy app.

            #### Examples

            ###### Loading third party code snippet like Google Analytics:

            To add [Google Analytics](/https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs) to a Lowdefy app, the `lowdefy.yaml` can be setup with:

            ```yaml
            name: google-analytics-example
            lowdefy: 3.23.2
            # ...
            app:
              html:
                appendHead: |
                  <!-- Google Analytics -->
                  <script>
                  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
                  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
                  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
                  })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

                  ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');
                  ga('send', 'pageview');
                  </script>
                  <!-- End Google Analytics -->
            # ...
