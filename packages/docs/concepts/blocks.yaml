                A Lowdefy page is compiled out of an arrangement of blocks. Every HTML element of this page is rendered as a result of a block placed and configured on the page. A Lowdefy Block is just a React component. A large number of default blocks make it easy to build apps with Lowdefy, and for more specific requirements, custom blocks can be added to apps as [plugins](/plugins).

                Blocks make it simple for Lowdefy developers to create apps since they only have to decide which block type to use, where in the layout the block should render, and what the block should do by defining the block's `properties` and `events`. How a block implements these `properties` and `events` is up to the specific block type.

                All Lowdefy blocks are categorized according to their primary function:
                - `display` - Display page elements.
                - `input` - Modify a value in [`state`](/page-and-app-state).
                - `container` - Render other blocks into [`content areas`](/layout).
                - `list` - Render `content areas` and blocks for each element in the data array represented in [`state`](/page-and-app-state).

                When `state` updates or a requests call completes, the Lowdefy engine re-evaluates all operators and re-renders blocks for which the operator evaluation is different from the previous render result. The result is _live updates_ to all blocks on a page. Operators can be used to build _live update_ logic into all block fields, except for the `id`, `type`, `areas` and `blocks` fields.

                The schema for a Lowdefy block is:

                - `id: string`: An identifier for a block. For `Input` blocks the block `id` sets the field key which the block will modify in `state`. Field _dot-notation_ can be used to express fields which are nested in objects or arrays.
                - `type: string`: __Required__ - This is the block type identifier and defines what block to use. The block type used must either be a default block type or can defined in the app's [`plugins`](/plugins) configuration.
                - `properties: object`: All the settings passed to a block component. __Operators are evaluated__.
                - `blocks: array`: A array of blocks to render to the default `content` area for `container` and `list` blocks. See [layout](/layout-overview) for more details on how to use the `blocks` array.
                - `areas: object`: Used to set the content areas and content layout settings for `container` and `list` blocks. See [layout](/layout-overview) for more details on how to use `areas`.
                - `events: object`: Used to define [`actions`](/events-and-actions) that run when the block triggers an [`event`](/events-and-actions).
                - `layout: object`: Used to define the [layout](/layout-overview) settings for a block. __Operators are evaluated__.
                - `skeleton: object`: Used to overwrite a block's default loading behavior by rendering a skeleton. Any block types from [`@lowdefy/blocks-basic`](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy/tree/main/packages/plugins/blocks/blocks-basic/src/blocks) and [`@lowdefy/blocks-loaders`](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy/tree/main/packages/plugins/blocks/blocks-loaders/src/blocks) can be used in the skeleton definition, including sub-blocks. __Operators are evaluated__.
                - `loading: boolean`: When true, renders the block in loading. If a `skeleton` is defined, it will be rendered, else the block's default loading behavior will be rendered. __Operators are evaluated__.
                - `required: boolean | string`: For `input` blocks, whether or not a value is required in `state` when the [`Validate`](/Validate) action is called. Can be either a boolean or a string that is used as the validation error message . __Operators are evaluated__.
                - `style: css object`: Used to apply css style settings to the block's top level `div` element. __Operators are evaluated__.
                - `validate: array`: A list of validation tests to pass when the [`Validate`](/Validate) action is called. __Operators are evaluated__.
                - `visible: boolean`: Controls whether or not to render a block. Operators are generally used here, and must evaluate to `false` to make the block invisible. Blocks with `visible: false` are excluded from `state`. __Operators are evaluated__.

                ## Block types

                Lowdefy has a set of default block types as defined in the Lowdefy docs. Most of the default Lowdefy blocks aim to cover a very generic implementation of the [Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/overview/) React component library, but some addition component libraries are also included. To use all the default block types, you can simply use the block `type` key, such as [`Button`](/Button), [`TextInput`](/TextInput), or [`Box`](/Box).

                ###### Default block type config example:
                ```yaml
                lowdefy: {{ version }}
                pages:
                  - id: example_dashboard
                    type: PageHeaderMenu
                    blocks:
                      - id: basic_chart
                        type: EChart
                        properties:
                          # ... EChart properties
                ```

                However, the default types can be overwritten or additional types can be defined as required. This is done by defining additional [`plugins`](/plugins).

                ## Input block validation

                All `input` block types maintain a value in the page [`state`](/page-and-app-state). This value is set to the field name matching the block `id`. Nested fields can be created by using _dot notation_ in the `id` to specify the field path, for example, `id: "a.b.c"` will produce a value `{"a": {"b": {"c": null }}}` in the page `state`.

                Client side field validation can be applied by setting the `required` and / or `validate` block fields. Field validation is first evaluated when the [`Validate`](/Validate) action is invoked on a page.

                ##### required schema:

                `required` can be a `boolean` or `string` type. When `required: true` the field label will indicate this with a red asterisk for user feedback, and a value will have to be supplied to the field in order to pass validation. If `required` is set to a `string`, this string will be used as the feedback message when the validation fails.

                ```yaml
                - id: name
                  type: TextInput
                  required: Please provide your name.
                  properties:
                    title: Name
                ```

                ##### validate schema:

                The `validate` field takes an `array` of test `objects` to evaluate before passing the field validation. This list of tests are evaluated sequentially, so the first test that fails will be used as the feedback message to the user.

                The schema for the validation test `objects`:
                - `pass: boolean`: __Required__ - The test that validates if this item passes or not. This is usually written with operators which evaluate to `true` or `false`. __Operators are evaluated__.
                - `message: string`: __Required__ - The feedback message to the user if this validation tests fails. __Operators are evaluated__.
                - `status: enum`: The feedback type to present to the user. Option are `error` and `warning`. Default is `error`. __Operators are evaluated__.

                The following `validate` example first verifies that something was entered into the `email` field, then checks that the field passes a email regex validation using the [`_regex`](/_regex) operator:

                ```yaml
                  - id: email
                    type: TextInput
                    validate:
                      - message: Please enter a email address.
                        status: error
                        pass:
                          _ne:
                            - _state: email
                            - null
                      - message: Please provide a valid email address.
                        status: error
                        pass:
                          _regex: '^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$'
                    properties:
                      title: Email
                ```

                ## Block events

                By default all blocks implement `onMount` and `onMountAsync` events. Both the `onMount` and `onMountAsync` events are triggered when the block is mounted. For the `onMount` event, the block only mounts when the event action chain is completed, however, for the `onMountAsync` event, the block will mount as soon as possible while the event actions complete execution.

                Apart from the `onMount` and `onMountAsync` events, most blocks also implement their own block specific events such as `onOpen` for [Modal](/Modal) or `onClick` for [Button](/Button). See the events tab on each block's documentation for more details.

                See [the events and actions page](/events-and-actions) for more details.

                ## Block loading

                Blocks will only start rendering when the `onInit` event has completed its actions. The `onMount` event on blocks will render blocks with loading active. By default, some blocks will change behavior while they are loading. For example, input blocks will be disabled during loading. The loading behavior of blocks can be controlled using the `loading` block property. Setting `loading` to `true` on a container or list block, will result in rendering all child blocks with loading active.

                Often it is useful to render a skeleton of blocks instead of the blocks' default loading behavior. When block definitions are provided to the `skeleton` property on a block, this `skeleton` definition will be rendered when loading is active. Any block types from [`@lowdefy/blocks-basic`](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy/tree/main/packages/plugins/blocks/blocks-basic/src/blocks) and [`@lowdefy/blocks-loaders`](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy/tree/main/packages/plugins/blocks/blocks-loaders/src/blocks) can be used as the skeleton definition. Skeleton blocks are not real blocks, they do not have values in state or events, but they can contain other skeleton blocks as children.

                ##### Block `loading` and `skeleton` example:

                ```yaml
                pages:
                  - id: page_one
                    type: Box
                    blocks:
                      # ...
                      - id: paragraph_one
                        type: Paragraph
                        loading:
                          _eq:
                            - _state: done
                            - false
                        skeleton:
                          type: SkeletonParagraph
                          properties:
                            lines: 1
                        properties:
                          content: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
                      # ...
                ```

                ## TLDR
                  - All user interfaces in Lowdefy are assembled out of blocks, which are React components.
                  #### Block types
                  - There are four block categories: `display`, `input`, `container` and `list`.
                  - Operators re-evaluate on every [`state`](/page-and-app-state) update or when request calls complete. This allows blocks to _live update_.
                  - Lowdefy has built in default block types, however this can be overwritten or extended with custom blocks by defining [`plugins`](/plugins) on the Lowdefy config root.
                  - `input` blocks maintain a value in `state` matching the block `id` key. _Dot notation_ applies to specify nested fields.
                  #### Block validation
                  - Field level input validation can be achieved by marking an `input` block as `required` or by specifying a list of `validate` tests.
                  - Validation is invoked using the [`Validate`](/Validate) action.
                  #### Block events
                  - All blocks have`onMount` and `onMountAsync` events.
                  - Each block implements it's own additional events such as `onClick` etc.
                  #### Block loading
                  - Some blocks gracefully handle a loading state while `onMount` events are being executed.
                  - A block's default loading can be overwritten by defining custom `skeleton` settings on a block.
