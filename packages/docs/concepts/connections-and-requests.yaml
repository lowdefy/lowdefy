            ### TLDR
              - `connections` define links to other services, like connecting to a database. They are defined at the root of the lowdefy configuration.
              - `requests` use connections to make a call to the connected external services.
              - Use the [`_secret`](/_secret) operator to reference API keys or other secrets as required - do not code secrets into your config or commit secrets to your config source control.

            -----------
            In a Lowdefy app you can integrate with other services like API's or databases using `connections` and `requests`. Connections configure the connection settings to the service, and often contain parameters like connection strings, urls and secrets like passwords or API keys. Requests are used to interact with the connection, like inserting a data record, executing a query or calling a API end-point.

      - id: alert2
        type: Alert
        properties:
          type: warning
          showIcon: false
          message: Sensitive information like passwords or API keys are often required to use external services. The _secret operator should be used to reference these secrets, they should never be coded directly in your app, or committed to source control.

            # Connections

            Connections are defined at the root of your Lowdefy configuration, in the `connections` array. Each connection must have an `id`, a `type`, and `properties` defining the connection. Operators in connection properties are evaluated every time a request is called.

            # Connection Schema

            The schema for a Lowdefy connection is:

            - `id: string`: __Required__ - A unique identifier for the connection. This is used by requests to specify which connection to use.
            - `type: string`: __Required__ - The connection type to be used.
            - `properties: object`: The settings passed to the connection. __Operators are evaluated__.

            ###### Connections definition example:
            ```yaml
            lowdefy: LOWDEFY_VERSION
            connections:
              - id: connection1
                type: ConnectionType1
                properties:
                  # ...
              - id: connection2
                type: ConnectionType2
                properties:
                  # ...
            pages:
              # ...
            ```

            Our goal is to make connections for everything. As the Lowdefy community grows, we will continue to develop the most requested connections. If the connection you require is not supported yet, please head over to our [new connections voting board](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy/discussions/309) to request and vote for new connections.

            # Requests

            Requests can be defined on any block, and the results of the request are available to any block in the same context. Requests must have an `id`, `type`, `connectionId` field specifying the connection to use, and `properties` defining the request settings. Requests can be called using the [`Request`](/Request) action. Operators in request properties are evaluated every time a request is called.

            # Request Schema

            The schema for a Lowdefy request is:

            - `id: string`: __Required__ - A identifier for the request. It must be unique within the context the request is defined in.
            - `type: string`: __Required__ - The request type to be used. It must be a type supported by the connection type.
            - `connectionId: string`: __Required__ - The `id` of the connection that should be used.
            - `properties: object`: The settings passed to the request. __Operators are evaluated__.

            ###### Requests definition example:
            ```yaml
            id: block_with_requests
            type: BlockType
            requests:
              - id: request1
                type: RequestType1
                connectionId: connectionId1
                properties:
                  # ...
              - id: request2
                type: RequestType2
                connectionId: connectionId2
                properties:
                  # ...
            properties:
              # ...
            ```
