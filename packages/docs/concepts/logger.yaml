            Lowdefy provides built-in error logging and monitoring capabilities. When properly configured, errors from both client and server are captured and sent to external logging services.

            ## Sentry Integration

            [Sentry](https://sentry.io) is a popular error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Lowdefy has built-in Sentry integration that captures errors with rich context including page IDs, block IDs, and config file locations.

            ### Quick Start

            To enable Sentry, set the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable:

            ```
            SENTRY_DSN=https://your-dsn@sentry.io/project
            ```

            With this environment variable set, Sentry will capture errors from both client and server with sensible defaults.

            ### Client-Side Configuration

            For client-side error capture, you also need to expose the DSN to the browser:

            ```
            NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-dsn@sentry.io/project
            ```

            ### Configuration Options

            You can customize Sentry behavior using the `logger` configuration in your `lowdefy.yaml`:

            ```yaml
            lowdefy: 4.5.2

            logger:
              sentry:
                # Enable/disable client-side logging (default: true)
                client: true
                # Enable/disable server-side logging (default: true)
                server: true
                # Sample rate for performance traces (default: 0.1)
                tracesSampleRate: 0.1
                # Sample rate for session replay (default: 0)
                replaysSessionSampleRate: 0
                # Sample rate for replay on errors (default: 0.1)
                replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 0.1
                # Enable user feedback widget (default: false)
                feedback: false
                # Override environment detection (default: auto from NODE_ENV)
                environment: production
                # User fields to include in error reports (default: ['id', '_id'])
                userFields:
                  - id
                  - _id
            ```

            ### Default Configuration

            If you only set `SENTRY_DSN` without any `logger.sentry` configuration, these defaults are used:

            | Option | Default | Description |
            |--------|---------|-------------|
            | `client` | `true` | Client-side error capture enabled |
            | `server` | `true` | Server-side error capture enabled |
            | `tracesSampleRate` | `0.1` | 10% of transactions traced |
            | `replaysSessionSampleRate` | `0` | Session replay disabled by default |
            | `replaysOnErrorSampleRate` | `0.1` | 10% of error sessions replayed |
            | `feedback` | `false` | User feedback widget disabled |
            | `userFields` | `['id', '_id']` | Only user ID fields logged |

            ### User Context

            For authenticated users, Sentry automatically captures user context based on the `userFields` configuration. By default, only `id` and `_id` fields from the user session are included to avoid logging PII (personally identifiable information).

            To include additional fields:

            ```yaml
            logger:
              sentry:
                userFields:
                  - id
                  - _id
                  - organization_id
            ```

      - id: warning_pii
        type: Alert
        properties:
          type: warning
          icon: AiFillWarning
          description: Be careful not to include personally identifiable information (PII) like email addresses in userFields unless required and compliant with your privacy policy.

            ### Source Maps

            To enable readable stack traces in Sentry, set the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable during build:

            ```
            SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
            ```

            This will upload source maps to Sentry during the Next.js build process.

            ### Environment Variables

            | Variable | Description |
            |----------|-------------|
            | `SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry Data Source Name (DSN) for server-side error capture |
            | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | The same DSN exposed to the client for browser error capture |
            | `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | (Optional) Auth token for source map uploads during build |

            Example `.env` file:

            ```
            # .env
            SENTRY_DSN=https://abc123@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/1234567
            NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://abc123@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/1234567
            SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
            ```

            ### Disabling Sentry

            To disable Sentry for specific environments:

            - **Disable client only:** Set `logger.sentry.client: false`
            - **Disable server only:** Set `logger.sentry.server: false`
            - **Disable completely:** Remove the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable

            ### Error Context

            When errors are captured, Lowdefy automatically includes:

            - **Page ID:** The current page where the error occurred
            - **Block ID:** The block that triggered the error (if applicable)
            - **Config Location:** The source file and line number in your YAML config
            - **User Context:** Configured user fields for authenticated sessions
