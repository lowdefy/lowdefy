            The `secrets` object is a object that can be used to securely store sensitive information like passwords and API keys. Secrets can be accessed using the [`_secret`](/_secret) operator.

            The secrets object only exists on the backend server, and therefore the `_secret` operator can only be used in `connections` and `requests`.

            We intend to support multiple secrets strategies in the future (for example AWS Secrets Manager or Docker secrets). Current secrets can only be set with environment variables.

            ## Environment variables strategy

            Secrets can be set by creating an environment variable prefixed with `LOWDEFY_SECRET_`. The secret will then be available in the secrets object with the remaining part ot the name as key.

            For example, if the environment variable `LOWDEFY_SECRET_MY_SECRET` is set to `supersecret`, then `_secret: MY_SECRET` will return `supersecret`.

            Only strings can be set as environment variables. To store a object as a secret, the object can be JSON stringified, and parsed using the `_json.parse` operator.

            To store secrets that contain newline characters, the secret can be base64 encoded, and decoded using the `_base64.decode` operator.

            To use secrets in the local development environment, environment variables can be set using a `.env` file. Create a file called `.env` at the root of the project directory. Then set environment variables as:

            ```
            # .env
            LOWDEFY_SECRET_MY_SECRET=supersecret
            ```
