            The Lowdefy CLI is used to develop a Lowdefy app locally, and to build Lowdefy apps for deployment.

            We recommend running the CLI using `npx`, to always use the latest version:

            ```
            npx lowdefy@latest <command>
            ```

            or, to use a specific version:

            ```
            npx lowdefy@version <command>
            ```

            Alternative, you can install the CLI globally or to a npm project (with a `package.json` file) via npm or yarn.

            To install the CLI globally run:

            ```
            npm install lowdefy -g
            ```

            The CLI can then be run using `lowdefy` as the executable name:

            ```
            lowdefy <command>
            ```

            # CLI commands

            ## build

            The `build` command runs a Lowdefy build. The options are:

            - `--config-directory <config-directory>`: Change config directory. The default is the current working directory.
            - `--blocks-server-url <blocks-server-url>`: The URL from where Lowdefy blocks will be served. See below for more information.
            - `--disable-telemetry`: Disable telemetry.
            - `--output-directory <output-directory>`: Change the directory to which build artifacts are saved. The default is `<config-directory>/.lowdefy/build`.
            - `--ref-resolver <ref-resolver-function-path>`: Path to a JavaScript file containing a `_ref` resolver function to be used as the app default `_ref` resolver.

            ## build-netlify
            The `build-netlify` command creates a production build for the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) web hosting service. It is designed to run as the Netlify build command.

            We recommend setting the build command to `npx lowdefy@latest build-netlify`. The Netlify publish directory should be set to `.lowdefy/publish`, and the functions directory set to `.lowdefy/functions`.

            - `--config-directory <config-directory>`: Change config directory. The default is the current working directory (The config directory should rather be configured in the Netlify build settings).
            - `--blocks-server-url <blocks-server-url>`: The URL from where Lowdefy blocks will be served. See below for more information.
            - `--disable-telemetry`: Disable telemetry.
            - `--ref-resolver <ref-resolver-function-path>`: Path to a JavaScript file containing a `_ref` resolver function to be used as the app default `_ref` resolver.

            ## clean-cache

            The Lowdefy CLI caches block metadata, and build and server scripts in the `.lowdefy/cache` directory. These cached files can be removed using the `clean-cache` command.

            - `--config-directory <config-directory>`: Change config directory. The default is the current working directory.
            - `--disable-telemetry`: Disable telemetry.

            ## dev

            The `dev` command starts a Lowdefy development server, running locally. It can be accessed in a browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The CLI watches the file system, and rebuilds the app and reloads served pages every time a change is made to any of the files in the project directory.

            - `--config-directory <config-directory>`: Change config directory. The default is the current working directory.
            - `--blocks-server-url <blocks-server-url>`: The URL from where Lowdefy blocks will be served. See below for more information.
            - `--disable-telemetry`: Disable telemetry.
            - `--port <port>`: Change the port the server is hosted at. The default is `3000`.
            - `--ref-resolver <ref-resolver-function-path>`: Path to a JavaScript file containing a `_ref` resolver function to be used as the app default `_ref` resolver.
            - `--watch <paths...>`: A list of paths to files or directories that should be watched for changes.
            - `--watch-ignore <patterns...>`: A list of paths to files or directories that should be ignored by the file watcher. Globs are supported.

            #### Examples


            Run the dev server, watching a relative directory for file changes:
            ```txt
            npx lowdefy@latest dev --watch ../other-project
            ```

            Run the dev server, ignoring the public directory:
            ```txt
            npx lowdefy@latest dev --watch-ignore public/**
            ```

            # Configuration

            All the CLI options can either be set as command line options, or the `cli` config object in your `lowdefy.yaml` file. Options set as command line options take precedence over options set in the `lowdefy.yaml` file. The config in the `lowdefy.yaml` cannot be referenced using the `_ref` operator, but need to be set in the file itself.

            Options set in the `lowdefy.yaml` should be defined in camelCase. The options that can be set are:
            - `blocksServerUrl: string`: The URL from where Lowdefy blocks will be served. See below for more information.
            - `disableTelemetry: boolean`: Disable telemetry.
            - `outputDirectory: string`: Change the directory to which build artifacts are saved. The default is `<config-directory>/.lowdefy/build`.
            - `refResolver: string`: Path to a JavaScript file containing a `_ref` resolver function to be used as the app default `_ref` resolver.
            - `port: number`: Change the port the server is hosted at. The default is `3000`.
            - `watch: string[]`: A list of paths to files or directories that should be watched for changes.
            - `watchIgnore: string[]`: A list of paths to files or directories that should be ignored by the file watcher. Globs are supported.

            The `--config-directory` option cannot be set from the `lowdefy.yaml` file.


            # Telemetry

            The CLI collects usage and error information to help us fix bugs, prioritize features, and understand how Lowdefy is being used.

            All telemetry can be disabled by setting the `disableTelemetry` flag in `cli` config object in your `lowdefy.yaml` file (this cannot be a reference to another file), or by using the `--disable-telemetry` command line flag.:

            ###### `lowdefy.yaml`
            ```yaml
            lowdefy: LOWDEFY_VERSION

            cli:
              disableTelemetry: true
            ```

            We collect the following information:

            - The CLI version.
            - The Lowdefy version of your app.
            - A random local app id (stored locally in your project folder at `.lowdefy/cli.json`).
            - The CLI command used.
            - If the CLI is being used in the Netlify CI environment (when using the `build-netlify` command).
            - Your IP address.
            - Error messages and stack traces for any errors.

            # Blocks Server

            The Lowdefy default blocks are not included in the Lowdefy build output, but are served from a CDN, and imported into the app using webpack module federation. All the default Lowdefy blocks are hosted at:

            ```yaml
            https://blocks-cdn.lowdefy.com/v{LOWDEFY_VERSION}/
            ```

            If you wish to host your own blocks instead, this url can be configured using the `--blocks-server-url` CLI option. This URL should serve the build artifacts of the Lowdefy default block packages (located in the `dist` directory). Each blocks package should be served under a path that corresponds to the package name. For example, `@lowdefy/blocks-basic` should be served under `{BLOCK_SERVER_URL}/blocks-basic/`. The required blocks packages and server paths are:

              - `@lowdefy/blocks-basic` to be hosted at `{BLOCK_SERVER_URL}/blocks-basic/`.
              - `@lowdefy/blocks-antd` to be hosted at `{BLOCK_SERVER_URL}/blocks-antd/`.
              - `@lowdefy/blocks-color-selectors` to be hosted at `{BLOCK_SERVER_URL}/blocks-color-selectors/`.
              - `@lowdefy/blocks-markdown` to be hosted at `{BLOCK_SERVER_URL}/blocks-markdown/`.
              - `@lowdefy/blocks-echarts` to be hosted at `{BLOCK_SERVER_URL}/blocks-echarts/`.

            If you wish to run the CLI dev server, the `@lowdefy/renderer` package build artifacts (located in the `dist` directory) should also be served from `{BLOCK_SERVER_URL}/renderer/`.
