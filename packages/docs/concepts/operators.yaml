            Operators are functions, that can be used to express logic. They are the reason why Lowdefy apps are not completely static, but can react to data and inputs. Operators can be used in `blocks`, `actions`, `requests`, and `connections`. See the specific documentation for more details.

            Each operators expects arguments with a specific structure. They can be the result of other operators, since operators are evaluated beginning with the most nested operators.

            If an operator errors while evaluating, it returns a `null` value, and logs the error to the console.

            ## Client or server operators

            Some operators are only available on either the client or the server. For example, the [`_menu`](/_menu) operator is only useful on the client and is thus not included in server requests. Likewise, the [`_secret`](/_secret) operator is only available on the server for security reasons.

            If a operator has special environment considerations, it is indicated on the individual operator documentation page. If no indication is made, the operator can be used under both environments.

            ##### Client only operators:
            - [_actions](/_actions)
            - [_media](/_media)
            - [_menu](/_menu)
            - [_request](/_request)

            ##### Server only operators:
            - [_diff](/_diff)
            - [_secret](/_secret)
            - [_uuid](/_uuid)

            Operators that are client side only cannot be used in `Requests` and `Connections`, and operators which are server side only cannot be used in `Blocks` and `Actions`.

            ## Build time operators

            Besides the client and server environment, app build time is considered a third environment where special operator logic applies.

            The `_ref` and `_var` operators do not work like other operators. They are evaluated while an app is being built, and can thus be used anywhere in the app configuration. They are used to split an app into multiple files, and to reuse configuration. See [`_ref`](/_ref) for more details.

            Some operators can be evaluated at build time by using the [`_build`](/_build) operator. This is useful for once-off calculations when an app is built, for example looping over a list in a reference JSON file to calculate a value at build time instead of using normal operators which re-evaluate whenever the app state changes. It can also be used to read an environment variable.
