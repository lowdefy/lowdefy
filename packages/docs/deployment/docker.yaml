            The [official Lowdefy Docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lowdefy/lowdefy) images can be found on Docker Hub.

            Examples of Docker configuration can be found in the [example repository](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy-example-docker).

            The Lowdefy Docker images contain a Lowdefy server. The configuration of the Lowdefy app can either be built into a new image based on the Lowdefy image, or the configuration read from the file system, usually provided as a volume.

            The Lowdefy server can be configured using the following environment variables:

            - `LOWDEFY_SERVER_BASE_PATH`: Set the base path to serve the Lowdefy application from. This will serve the application under `https://example.com/<base-path>`instead of `https://example.com`,  and all pages under `https://example.com/<base-path>/<page-id>` instead of the default `https://example.com/<page-id>`.
            - `LOWDEFY_SERVER_BUILD_DIRECTORY`: The directory of the built Lowdefy configuration (The output of `lowdefy build`, usually found at `./.lowdefy/build` in your project repository). The default is `./build` (or `/home/node/lowdefy/build`).
            - `LOWDEFY_SERVER_PUBLIC_DIRECTORY`: The directory of the public assets to be served. The default is `./public` (or `/home/node/lowdefy/public`).
            - `LOWDEFY_SERVER_PORT`: The port (inside the container) at which to run the server. The default is `3000`.

            # Building a Lowdefy app image

            To build the configuration into an image, the following Dockerfile can be used:
            ```text
            FROM node:14-buster AS build

            # Set working directory and node user
            WORKDIR /home/node/lowdefy

            RUN chown node:node /home/node/lowdefy

            USER node

            # Copy app config and change ownership of files to "node" user
            COPY  --chown=node:node  . .

            # Build the Lowdefy config using the Lowdefy CLI
            RUN npx lowdefy@latest build

            # Use the correct Lowdefy base image
            FROM lowdefy/lowdefy:3.20.0

            # Copy build output from build stage
            COPY --from=build --chown=node:node /home/node/lowdefy/.lowdefy/build ./build

            # Copy contents of public directory into image
            COPY --chown=node:node ./public ./public

            # Run the server on start
            CMD ["node", "./dist/server.js"]
            ```

            with a `.dockerignore` file:

            ```
            .lowdefy/**
            .env
            ```

            An image can be built by running:
            ```
            docker build -t <tag> .
            ```

            The container can be run by:
            ```
            docker run -p 3000:3000 <tag>
            ```

            Docker compose can also be used. Use a `docker-compose.yaml` file:
            ```
            version: "3.8"
            services:
              lowdefy:
                build: .
                ports:
                  - "3000:3000"
            ```

            To build the image, run:
            ```
            docker compose build
            ```

            To run the app, run:
            ```
            docker compose up
            ```
