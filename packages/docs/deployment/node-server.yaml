            A production Lowdefy server that runs using Node.js is published on npm as [@lowdefy/server-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lowdefy/server-node).

            ## Running the server

            ### Step 1 - Create a `package.json` file

            To run the server in a Lowdefy project, first initialise a Node.js project by creating a `package.json` file in the root of your project. To do this, you can run

            ```
            npm init
            ```

            ### Step 2 - Add the `@lowdefy/server-node` package to your project as a dependency

            To add the server as a dependency, run

            ```
            npm install @lowdefy/server-node --save --save-exact
            ```

            ### Step 3 - Add the Lowdefy CLI to you project as a dev dependency.

            To add the server as a dependency, run:

            ```
            npm install lowdefy --save-dev --save-exact
            ```

            ### Step 4 - Add the `build` and `start` scripts.

            Add the following to the `scripts` section in your `package.json` file:

            ```json
            "scripts": {
              "init": "lowdefy init",
              "build": "lowdefy build",
              "start": "lowdefy-server"
            },
            ```

            ### Step 5 - Init a Lowdefy project

            Run:

            ```
            npm run init
            ```

            ### Step 6 - Add the public files:

            Create a folder called `public` in your project directory and add the Lowdefy public files found [here](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy/tree/main/packages/shell/src/public) (or add your own logos and files).

            ### Step 7 - Build the Lowdefy project

            Build the Lowdefy configuration files in the project by running:

            ```
            npm run build
            ```

            ### Step 8 - Start the server

            To start the server, run:

            ```
            npm run start
            ```

            ## Configuration

            The Lowdefy server can be configured using command-line arguments or environment variables. The command-line arguments take precedence over the environment variables.

            The following command-line arguments can be specified:

            - `--build-directory`: The directory of the built Lowdefy configuration (The output of `lowdefy build`, usually found at `./.lowdefy/build` in your project repository). The default is `./.lowdefy/build`.
            - `--port`: The port at which to run the server. The default is `3000`.
            - `--public-directory`: The directory of the public assets to be served. The default is `./public`.


            The following environment variables can be specified:

            - `LOWDEFY_SERVER_BASE_PATH`: Set the base path to serve the Lowdefy application from. This will serve the application under `https://example.com/<base-path>`instead of `https://example.com`,  and all pages under `https://example.com/<base-path>/<page-id>` instead of the default `https://example.com/<page-id>`.
            - `LOWDEFY_SERVER_BUILD_DIRECTORY`: The directory of the built Lowdefy configuration (The output of `lowdefy build`, usually found at `./.lowdefy/build` in your project repository). The default is `./.lowdefy/build`.
            - `LOWDEFY_SERVER_PORT`: The port at which to run the server. The default is `3000`.
            - `LOWDEFY_SERVER_PUBLIC_DIRECTORY`: The directory of the public assets to be served. The default is `./public`.
