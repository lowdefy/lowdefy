            Lowdefy apps can be deployed to AWS Lambda serverless functions by using the [lowdefy/lowdefy-aws-lambda](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lowdefy/lowdefy-aws-lambda) Docker images. These images contain a Lowdefy app server. To deploy to AWS Lambda a new image that contains the app configuration, based on the Lowdefy base image, should be built. This image should then be pushed to a private AWS ECR registry. From there it can be used to create a Lambda function.

            The [serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com) can be used to simplify the deployment. The serverless framework create a ECR registry if it does not exist, build the Docker image, push to the registry and deploy an AWS Lambda function with a API Gateway HTTP api integration.

            An example can be found in the [lowdefy-example-aws-lambda](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy-example-aws-lambda)  repository.

            ## Deploying to AWS Lambda

            ### Requirements

            - The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) should be installed and authenticated.
            - You should have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

            ### Step 1 - Create a Dockerfile

            Create a file called `Dockerfile` in your project repository:

            ```
            FROM node:14-buster AS build

            # Set working directory and node user
            WORKDIR /home/node/lowdefy

            RUN chown node:node /home/node/lowdefy

            USER node

            # Copy app config, and change ownership of files to "node" user
            COPY  --chown=node:node  . .

            # Build the Lowdefy config using the Lowdefy CLI
            RUN npx lowdefy@latest build

            # Use the correct Lowdefy base image
            FROM lowdefy/lowdefy-aws-lambda:3.20.1

            # Copy build output from build stage
            COPY --from=build /home/node/lowdefy/.lowdefy/build ./build

            # Copy contents of public directory into image
            COPY ./public ./public

            # Lambda handler
            CMD [ "dist/server.handler"]
            ```

            ### Step 2 - Create a `.dockerignore` file

            Create a file called `.dockerignore` in your project repository:

            ```
            .lowdefy/**
            .serverless/**
            .env
            ```

            ### Step 3 - Create a serverless.yaml file

            Create a file called `serverless.yaml` in your project repository:

            ```
            service: lowdefy-example-aws-lambda
            frameworkVersion: '2'
            provider:
              name: aws
              region: us-east-1
              ecr:
                images:
                  lowdefy:
                    path: .
                    file: Dockerfile

            functions:
              lowdefy-server:
                image: lowdefy
                name: lowdefy-example-aws-lambda-${opt:stage}
                # Set secrets as environment variables here
                # environment:
                #   LOWDEFY_SECRET_MY_SECRET: ${env:LOWDEFY_SECRET_MY_SECRET}

                events:
                  - httpApi: '*'
            ```

            ### Step 4 - Deploy to AWS

            Deploy to AWS by running:

            ```
            npx serverless deploy --verbose --conceal --stage dev
            ```
