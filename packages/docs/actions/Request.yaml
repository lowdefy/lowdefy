            The `Request` action calls a request, or if used during an onInit or onEnter action, calls those requests while a page loads.
            `Request` can be used to call all requests on a page, a list of requests, or a single request. The `Request` action is synchronous, actions defined after
            it will only run once all the called requests have returned.

            To call requests that load data, the `onInitAsync` and `onEnterAsync` actions can be used. These will execute the actions while the page begins to render. If the `onInit` or `onEnter` actions are used, the page will only start rendering after the actions have completed.

            ### Parameters
            `Request` can be called without any parameters to call all requests in the context. It can also be called with a list of requestIds or a single requestId to call.

            ### Examples

            Call all requests by specifying no params:

            ```
            - id: call_all
              type: Request
            ```

            Call a single request:
            ```
            - id: call_one_request
              type: Request
              params: my_request_id
            ```

            Call a list of requests:
            ```
            - id: call_many_requests
              type: Request
              params:
                - my_request_id_1
                - my_request_id_2
                - my_request_id_3
            ```
