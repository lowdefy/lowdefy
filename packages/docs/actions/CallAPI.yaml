    description: |
      The `CallAPI` action invokes a server-side API endpoint defined in your Lowdefy application's configuration.
      It sends an optional payload to the API and returns the response data, making it a way to execute server-side logic and orchestrate database operations from your Lowdefy pages.

    params: |
      ###### object
        - `endpointId: string`: __Required__ - The id of the API endpoint to call.
        - `payload: object`: Used to pass data such as state values from the app client to the endpoint as required.

    examples: |
      ###### Call an API endpoint:
      ```yaml
      - id: call_my_api
        type: CallAPI
        params:
          endpointId: my_api_endpoint
      ```

      ###### Call an API endpoint with a payload:
      ```yaml
      - id: call_rating_api
        type: CallAPI
        params:
          endpointId: review_product
          payload:

      ```

      ###### Call an API endpoint with client state as the payload:
      ```yaml
      - id: call_my_api
        type: CallAPI
        params:
          endpointId: my_api_endpoint
