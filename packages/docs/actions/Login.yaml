    description: |
      The `Login` action requests the OpenID provider's authorization URL from the Lowdefy server. The user is redirected to this URL, which normally hosts a login page. If the user is already logged in at the provider, the provider might redirect the user back without requiring a password again.

      The `Login` action can be used to update the `user` object, for example to update the user profile after it has been edited, or to make sure the user token is still valid before editing or creating a record in a database.

      See [here](/login-and-logout) for information on logging in.
    params: |
      ###### object
      - `authUrlQueryParams: object`: Query parameters to set for the authorization URL.
      - `pageId: string`: The pageId of the page to redirect to after the login flow is complete
      - `input: object`: The input to set for the page the user is redirected to after login.
      - `urlQuery: object`: The urlQuery to set for the page the user is redirected to after login.
