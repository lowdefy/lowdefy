            The `Link` action is used to link a user to another page. An input can be passed to the next page using either the
            `urlQuery`, which is visible to the user, but persists if the browser is refreshed, or by using the `input` object, which is not
            visible to the user.

            ### Parameters

            As a shorthand, only the pageId can be specified as a string. Else an object with the following parameters can be specified:
            - `pageId`: _String_ - The pageId of a page in the app to link to.
            - `home`: _Boolean_ - Link to the home page. This is either the configured public or authenticated homepage, or the first page in the default menu visible to the user.
            - `url`: _String_ - Link to an external url.
            - `newWindow`: _Boolean_ - Open the link in a new window.
            - `urlQuery`: _Object_ - Object to set as the urlQuery for the linked page.
            - `input`: _Object_ - Object to set as the input for the linked page.

            ### Examples

            Shorthand, only specify pageId as string:

            ```
            - id: shorthand
              type: Link
              params: my_page_id
            ```

            Specify pageId:

            ```
            - id: link_page_id
              type: Link
              params:
                pageId: myPageId
            ```

            ```
            - id: link_home
              type: Link
              params:
                home: true
            ```

            Link to an external url:
            ```
            - id: link_url

              type: Link
              params:
                pageId: my_page_id
                newWindow: true
            ```

            Set the urlQuery of the page that is linked to:
            ```
            - id: link_url_query
              type: Link
              params:
                pageId: my_page_id
                urlQuery:
                  id:
                    _state: id
            ```

                input:
                  id:
                    _args: row.id
            ```
