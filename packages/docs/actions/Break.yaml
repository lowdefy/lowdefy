      ##### TODO: This page needs to be updated.

      The `Break` action is used throw an error to the user and log to the console. If `throw: true`, the `Break`
      action will throw an error, and this will stop the execution of actions that are defined after it. If the action does not thrown, the `Break` action will do nothing and the actions defined after it will be executed.

    params: |
      - `throw: boolean`: Breaks an error and stops the action chain when `true` or continues the action chain when `false` or undefined.
      - `message: string`: The error message to show to the user and log to the console if `throw: true`. This message can be overridden by setting the action's `messages.error`.
      - `metaData: any`: Data to log to the console if `throw: true`.

    examples: |
      ###### Break with custom message:
      ```yaml
      - id: throw
        type: Break
        params:
          throw:
            _eq:
              - _state: lukes_father
              - Darth Vader
          message: Nooooooooooooooooo
      ```

      ###### Break with metaData:
      ```yaml
      - id: throw
        type: Break
        params:
          throw:
            _eq:
              - _state: lukes_father
              - Darth Vader
          message: Nooooooooooooooooo
          metaData:
            realisation: Luke kissed his sister
      ```
      ###### Override custom message:
      ```yaml
      - id: throw
        type: Break
        messages:
          error: Meh.
        params:
          throw:
            _eq:
              - _state: lukes_father
              - Darth Vader
          message: Nooooooooooooooooo
      ```
      ###### Fail silently:
      ```yaml
      - id: throw
        type: Break
        messages:
          error: false
        params:
          throw:
            _eq:
              - _state: lukes_father
              - Darth Vader
          message: Nooooooooooooooooo
      ```
