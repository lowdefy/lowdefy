      The `_mql` operator uses the [`mingo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mingo) package to evaluate MongoDB query language statements as an operator.
    methods:
      - name: aggregate
        types: |
          ```
          ({on: object[], pipeline: object[]}): object[]
          ([on: object[], pipeline: object[]]): object[]
          ```
        description: |
          The `_mql.aggregate` method runs a MongoDB aggregation pipeline on an input array.
        arguments: |
          ###### object
            - `on: object[]`: The data array on which to run the pipeline. It should be an array of objects.
            - `pipeline: object[]`: A MongoDB aggregation pipeline definition.
        examples: |
          ###### Transform request results:
          ```yaml
          _mql.aggregate:
            pipeline:
              - $match:
                  age:
                    $gte: 18
              - $addFields:
                  averageScore:
                    $avg:
                      - $score1
                      - $score2
            on:
              _request: my_request
          ```

      - name: expr
        types: |
          ```
          ({on: object, expr: any}): any
          ([on: object, expr: any]): any
          ```
        description: |
          The `_mql.expr` method evaluates a MongoDB aggregation pipeline operator expression. This is any statement that could be written in a `$project` stage.
        arguments: |
          ###### object
            - `on: object`: An object to take as input for the expression.
            - `expr: object`: A MongoDB aggregation expression.
        examples: |
          ###### Calculate an average of three inputs:
          ```yaml
          _mql.expr:
            expr:
              $avg:
                - $input1
                - $input2
                - $input3
            on:
              _state: true
          ```

      - name: test
        types: |
          ```
          ({on: object, test: object}): boolean
          ([on: object, test: object]): boolean
          ```
        description: |
          The `_mql.test` method tests if a object matches a MongoDB filter/query expression.
        arguments: |
          ###### object
            - `on: object`: The object to be tested.
            - `test: object`: A MongoDB filter/query expression.
        examples: |
          ###### Test if a number input is greater than 100:
          ```yaml
          _mql.test:
            test:
              number_input:
                $gte: 18
            on:
              number_input:
                _state: number_input
          ```
