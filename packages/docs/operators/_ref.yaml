      The `_ref` operator can be used to reference a configuration file, in order to split the Lowdefy configuration into multiple files. More information on references and the Lowdefy configuration schema can be found [here](/lowdefy-schema).

      > The `_ref` operator is a build time operator: it is evaluated when the app configuration is being built. This means it is not evaluated dynamically as the app is running, and can be used anywhere in the configuration as long as the resulting configuration files are valid YAML.

      The `_ref` operator requires a file path to the file to be referenced, relative to the root directory of the project.

      If this file is a YAML or JSON file, and has file extension `.yaml`, `.yml`, or `.json`, the file is parsed as YAML/JSON, and the parsed result is included in the configuration.

      If this file is a Nunjucks template file, with file extension `.njk`, the file is parsed as a Nunjucks template, using any variables provided in the `vars` argument. If the file extension is `.yaml.njk`, `.yml.njk` or `.json.njk`, the template output is also parsed as YAML/JSON.

      If the file is not parsed (for example has an extension like `.txt`, `.md`, or `.html`), the file contents are included in the configuration as a string.

      ###### Variables

      Variables defined in the `vars` argument can be accessed in the referenced file using the [`_var`](/_var), and as template variables in Nunjucks files.

      ###### Resolver

      A resolver is a JavaScript function that overwrites the default way configuration files are read from the filesystem. It does not need to read from the filesystem, it could generate a value to return programmatically, or it could fetch the configuration using HTTP (from Github for example). The `resolver` argument should be the file path (relative to the root of the project) to a JavaScript file that exports a resolver function.

      The resolver function receives the `path`, `vars`, and a `context` object as arguments. If a resolver function is specified, the `path` argument to the `_ref` operator is optional, and does not need to correspond to a path to a file. If `path` ends with `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.json`, `.njk`, `.yaml.njk`, `.yml.njk`, or `.json.njk`, the returned result will be parsed as YAML/JSON/Nunjucks template.

      A default `_ref` resolver can be specified in the `lowdefy.yaml` `cli` section (as `refResolver`), or as a command-line option when running the CLI (as `--ref-resolver`). This resolver will then be used for all references in the app, unless another resolver is specified.

      ###### Transformer

      A transformer is a JavaScript function that receives the result of the `_ref` operator, and its `vars` as arguments. The value returned by this function will be included in the configuration as the final result of the `_ref` operator. The `transformer` argument should be the file path (relative to the root of the project) to a JavaScript file that exports a transformer function.

    arguments: |
      ###### string
      The file path to the referenced file, from the root of the project directory.

      ###### object
        - `path: string`:  The file path to the referenced file, from the root of the project directory. If no `resolver` is specified, `path` is required.
        - `resolver: string`: The file path to a JavaScript file, from the root of the project directory, that exports a resolver function.
        - `transformer: string`: The file path to a JavaScript file, from the root of the project directory, that exports a transformer function.
        - `vars: object`: An object to be used as variables for the `_var` operator in the referenced file, and as template variables in Nunjucks template files.

      Returns:
      ```
      lowdefy: '3.20.2'
      pages:
        - id: page1
          type: PageHeaderMenu
          blocks:
            # ...
        - id: page2
          type: PageHeaderMenu
          blocks:
            # ...
      ```

      ###### Using a standardized input label template:
      ```yaml
      blocks:
        - id: name
          type: TextInput
          properties:
            label:
              _ref:
                path: label.yaml
                vars:
                  title: Name
                  description: Your name and surname.
        - id: age
          type: NumberInput
          properties:
            label:
              _ref:
                path: label.yaml
                vars:
                  title: Age
                  description: Your age.
      ```
      ```yaml
      # label.yaml
      title:
        _var: title
      extra:
        _var: description
      span: 8
      colon: false
      extraStyle:
        color: '#546358'
      ```
      Returns:
      ```yaml
      blocks:
        - id: name
          type: TextInput
          properties:
            label:
              title: Name
              extra: Your name and surname.
              span: 8
              colon: false
              extraStyle:
                color: '#546358'
        - id: age
          type: NumberInput
          properties:
            label:
              title: Age
              extra: Your age.
              span: 8
              colon: false
              extraStyle:
                color: '#546358'
      ```

      ###### Local or shared resolver:

      This resolver function will first look for the configuration file in the current working directory, but if the file is not found it will be read from an adjacent "shared" directory. This pattern can be used to build apps that mostly use a shared configuration, with a few components that are customised per app.

      ```js
      // resolvers/useLocalOrSharedConfig.js
      const fs = require('fs')
      const path = require('path')
      const { promisify } = require('util');

      const readFilePromise = promisify(fs.readFile);

      async function useLocalOrSharedConfig(path, vars, context) {
        const localFile =  await readFilePromise(path.resolve(path), 'utf8');

        if (localFile) return localFile;

        return readFilePromise(path.resolve('../shared', path), 'utf8');
      }

      module.exports = useLocalOrSharedConfig;
      ```

      ```yaml
      // lowdefy.yaml
      lowdefy: 3.20.2

      cli:
        refResolver: resolvers/useLocalOrSharedConfig.js

      pages:
        - _ref: pages/local-page.yaml
        - _ref: pages/shared-page.yaml
      ```

      ###### This transformer adds a standard footer to each page:

      ```js
      //  transformers/addFooter.js

      function addFooter(page, vars) {
        const footer = {
          // ...
        };
        page.areas.footer = footer;
        return page;
      }
      module.exports = addFooter;
      ```
      ```yaml
      // lowdefy.yaml
      lowdefy: 3.20.2

      pages:
        - _ref:
            path: pages/page1.yaml
            transformer: transformers/addFooter.js
      ```
