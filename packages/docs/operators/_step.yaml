    description: |
      The `_step` operator returns the response value from a previously executed step in an API routine. This operator is only available within API routines and allows later steps to access data from earlier steps. If the step has not yet been executed or is still executing, the returned value is `null`. Dot notation and array indexes are supported for accessing nested properties.
    arguments: |
      ###### string
      The id of a step that has already been executed in the current API routine.

      ###### Using a step response:
      ```yaml
      routine:
        - id: get_user
          type: MongoDBFindOne
          connectionId: users-db
          properties:
            query:
              email:
                _payload: email

        - :return:
            _step: get_user
      ```
      Returns: The complete response object returned by the `get_user` step.

      ###### Using dot notation to access nested properties:
      ```yaml
      routine:
        - id: get_user
          type: MongoDBFindOne
          connectionId: users-db
          properties:
            query:
              email:
                _payload: email

        - id: get_orders
          type: MongoDBFind
          connectionId: orders-db
          properties:
            query:
              userId:
                _step: get_user._id  # Access the _id field from get_user
      ```

      ###### Using array indexes:
      ```yaml
      routine:
        - id: get_products
          type: MongoDBFind
          connectionId: products-db
          properties:
            query:
              category: 'electronics'

        - :return:
            first_product:
              _step: get_products.0  # Access the first element of the array
            first_product_name:
              _step: get_products.0.name  # Access a property of the first element
      ```

      ###### Chaining multiple steps:
      ```yaml
      routine:
        - id: create_order
          type: MongoDBInsertOne
          connectionId: orders-db
          properties:
            doc:
              items:
                _payload: items
              total:
                _payload: total

        - id: send_confirmation
          type: SendGridMail
          connectionId: email-service
          properties:
            to:
              _payload: customer_email
            template_data:
              order_id:
                _step: create_order.insertedId  # Use the inserted document's ID

        - :return:
            success: true
            order_id:
              _step: create_order.insertedId
            email_sent:
              _step: send_confirmation.success
      ```
