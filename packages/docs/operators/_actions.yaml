      The `_actions` operator returns the response value for a preceding action in the same event list.

      The action response object has the following structure:
      ```yaml
      error: Error,
      index: number,
      response: any,
      skipped: boolean,
      type: string,
      ```
    arguments: |
      ###### string
      If the `_actions` operator is called with a string equal to a preceding action id in the same event list, the action response object returned. If a string is passed which does not match preceding action id in the same event list, `null` is returned. Dot notation is supported.

      ###### boolean
      If the `_actions` operator is called with boolean argument `true`, an object with all the preceding action id responses in the same event list is returned.

    examples: |
      ##### Using a action response:
      ```yaml
      _actions: my_action.response
      ```
      Returns: The response returned by the action.

      ##### Setting a action response to `state`:
      ```yaml
      id: refresh
      type: Button
      events:
        onClick:
          - id: get_fresh_data
            type: Request
            skip:
              _state: should_not_fetch
            params: get_data
          - id: set_data
            type: SetState
            params:
              did_not_fetch_data:
                _actions: get_fresh_data.skipped
      ```

      ##### Setting a returned [`JsAction`](/JsAction) response to `state`:
      First register a custom JavaScript action: `getNormalizedEigenvector`
      ```yaml
      # file: lowdefy.yaml
      lowdefy: '3.17.0'
      app:
        html:
          appendHead: |
            <script type="text/javascript">
              const getNormalizedEigenvector = (context, ...args) => {
                const vectorLength = Math.sqrt(args.reduce((acc, curVal) => Math.pow(curVal, 2) + acc), 0);
                return args.map(val => val / vectorLength );
              }
              window.lowdefy.registerJsAction('getNormalizedEigenvector', getNormalizedEigenvector);
            </script>
      ```
      Then, calculate the vector and update state.
      ```yaml
      # onClick event on a block.
      id: calculate
      type: Button
      events:
        onClick:
          - id: get_normalized_eigenvector
            type: JsAction
            params:
              name: getNormalizedEigenvector
              args:
                - 1
                - 5
                - -12
                - 7
                - 4
          - id: update_state
            type: SetState
            params:
              normal_eigenvector:
                _actions: get_normalized_eigenvector.response
      ```
      In this example, state will now be equal to:
      ```yaml
      normal_eigenvector:
        - 0.06523280730534423
        - 0.3261640365267211
        - -0.7827936876641306
        - 0.45662965113740955
        - 0.2609312292213769
      ```
