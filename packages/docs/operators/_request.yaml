      The `_request` operator returns the response value of a request. If the request has not yet been called, or is still executing, the returned value is `null`. Dot notation and [block list indexes](/lists) are supported. For more detailed information about a request, the [_request_details](/_request_details) operator can be used.
    arguments: |
      ###### string
      The id of the request.

      ###### Using a request response:
      ```yaml
      _request: my_request
      ```
      Returns: The response returned by the request.

      ###### Using dot notation to get the data object from the response:
      ```yaml
      _request: my_request.data
      ```
      ###### Using dot notation to get the first element of an array response:
      ```yaml
      _request: array_request.0
      ```
      ###### Using dot notation and block list indexes to get the name field from the element corresponding to the block index of an array response:
      ```yaml
      _request: array_request.$.name
      ```
