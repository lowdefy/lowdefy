## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8a82fb0: feat!: Replace Next.js with Vite + Hono.

  Lowdefy servers no longer run on Next.js. The production server is a
  [Hono](https://hono.dev) app serving a [Vite](https://vite.dev)-built React
  client; the dev server runs Vite with the Hono app mounted as middleware,
  giving instant hot module replacement for plugin changes (~700ms instead of
  the previous 20–40s rebuild-and-restart cycle). Authentication moves from
  NextAuth v4 to the Auth.js v5 engine (`@auth/core` via `@hono/auth-js`) with
  the `auth:` YAML schema unchanged.

  **Your YAML config does not change.** `lowdefy build`, `lowdefy dev` and
  `lowdefy start` work as before.

  Breaking changes:

  - **Auth sessions invalidate once on upgrade.** The session cookie prefix
    changes from `next-auth.*` to `authjs.*` — users sign in again after the
    upgrade. Provider, adapter, callback and event configuration is unchanged.
  - **`NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is removed — rename it to `AUTH_SECRET`.** The build
    fails with a config error when auth providers are configured and
    `AUTH_SECRET` is not set. `NEXTAUTH_URL` still works as an Auth.js
    fallback, but `AUTH_URL` is the preferred name.
  - **Custom `next.config.js` files no longer apply.** Customize the client
    build with a `vite.config.js` in the server directory instead.
  - **`LOWDEFY_BUILD_OUTPUT_STANDALONE` is removed.** `lowdefy build` writes a
    complete runnable server to `.lowdefy/server` — copy that folder (or build
    in Docker) and run `node src/index.js`. See the updated Docker and node
    server deployment docs.
  - **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is removed.** Set `SENTRY_DSN` on the server —
    it is passed to the browser client at runtime, so rotating it no longer
    requires a rebuild. Source maps upload via `@sentry/vite-plugin` when
    `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is set.
  - **Page navigation is now client-side (SPA).** The first page load embeds
    config in the HTML; navigating fetches page config from `/api/page/*`
    without a full browser reload.

### Minor Changes

- c188656: feat: Scheduled API endpoints (cron) on Vercel.

  `Api` and `InternalApi` endpoints can now declare `schedules` to run their routine on a timer:

  ```yaml
  id: purge-stale-conversations
  type: Api
  schedules:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'
      payload: { mode: full }
    - cron: '*/15 * * * *'
      payload: { mode: incremental }
  routine:
    - id: purge
      type: MongoDBDeleteMany
      connectionId: conversations
      properties:
        filter: { updatedAt: { $lt: { _payload: cutoff } } }
  ```

  - **build**: `schedules` is validated (Vercel cron syntax, unique crons per endpoint, object
    payloads) and passed through to the endpoint artifact; a `build/schedules.json` manifest is
    emitted for scheduled endpoints.
  - **api/servers**: a new `/api/cron/*` route runs a scheduled endpoint's routine as a system context
    (no user session — `_user` is `undefined`), resolving the payload from the firing schedule via the
    `x-vercel-cron-schedule` header, and secured by the `CRON_SECRET` env var (fails closed).
  - **cli**: the Vercel deployment now uses the Build Output API. `lowdefy init-vercel` scaffolds a
    `vercel.build.sh` and a new `lowdefy vercel-output` command assembles `.vercel/output/`
    (static + one `api.func` + `config.json`), generating the `crons` array from the declared schedules
    on every deploy — nothing is committed by hand.

  This migrates how all Lowdefy Vercel apps deploy; re-run `lowdefy init-vercel` (or update the
  `deploy/` files by hand) after upgrading. Cron jobs run in UTC and are subject to Vercel plan limits
  (Hobby: daily only; Pro: per-minute).

- 60401aa: feat: Add `_app` operator and structured app metadata.

  The `_app` operator reads the app's declared metadata — `slug`, `name`,
  `version`, `description`, `license`, `lowdefyVersion`, `gitSha`. It
  resolves both at build time and at runtime (client and server) with
  identical values, including inside `modules-mongodb` request filters and
  inside `_js` functions via a bound `lowdefyApp(p)` callable. For
  build-time positions nested inside another `_build.*` operator (e.g. a
  `_build.object.fromEntries` map key), use the `_build.app` form so it
  resolves in time.

  A referenced `slug` is mandatory: `_app: slug` (or `_build.app: slug`)
  fails the build when `slug` is not declared, guarding against a `null`
  slug silently scoping namespaced data. The object form with an explicit
  `default` is the opt-out. Other fields return `null` when unset, and an
  app that never references `slug` need not declare it.

  The root `lowdefy.yaml` schema gains two new optional fields:

  - `slug` — a kebab-case identifier (`^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`),
    validated at build time. Build fails with a clear error if invalid.
  - `description` — a free-form string.

  Root metadata fields (`slug`, `name`, `description`, `version`,
  `license`, `lowdefy`) accept literals and `_build.*` operators only;
  `_ref`, `_var`, and static `_` operators are no longer resolved in these
  positions and fail the build with a clear error naming the field. Use
  `_build.env` for a deploy-time slug or name.

  `gitSha` resolves through a fallback chain: `LOWDEFY_GIT_SHA` env var
  when set non-empty → `git rev-parse HEAD` → `null`. This lets apps
  deployed without `.git` (Docker, Vercel, Netlify, Render, hermetic
  PaaS sandboxes) pin the SHA explicitly by mapping their platform's
  commit env var via shell expansion in the build command.

  Build emits a new `appMeta.json` artifact alongside `app.json`. The
  existing `app.git_sha` field is removed; consumers (internal telemetry)
  read `gitSha` from `appMeta` instead.

  See the `_app` operator reference for the full key set and examples.

- 37c8c14: feat: `auth.strategies` — apiKey and JWT header authentication for API callers.

  - New `auth.strategies` config block: apiKey (default `X-API-Key` header) and jwt strategies, each granting the caller the strategy's `roles`.
  - MCP and service clients that cannot hold a session cookie authenticate per request; a matched strategy yields a caller (`apiKey:{strategyId}:{keyId}`) that flows through the existing authorization and `_user` machinery.
  - Unauthenticated calls to role-gated endpoints now return 401 (`AuthenticationError`) instead of a masked error.

- 7ce6e36: feat: Per-environment cron schedules, forwarded from the production deployment.

  Vercel fires cron jobs only on the production deployment, so staging and other environments never
  ran their schedules. Declare the deployment environments once and Lowdefy registers every
  environment's schedules on production, forwarding the ones for other environments to that
  environment's own `/api/cron/<endpointId>` as a fire-and-forget ping:

  ```yaml
  config:
    cron:
      environments:
        production: {} # no url: the deployment Vercel fires crons on
        staging:
          url: https://staging.example.com
          secret: STAGING_CRON_SECRET # Lowdefy secret holding staging's CRON_SECRET
  ```

  `schedules` can then be keyed by environment, with a `default` every other environment inherits and
  `[]` turning crons off — including through module vars, so a module's
  `schedules: { _module.var: tick_schedule }` needs no change:

  ```yaml
  schedules:
    default:
      - cron: '*/5 * * * *'
    staging:
      - cron: '0 * * * *'
    develop: []
  ```

  - **build**: validates `config.cron` (exactly one environment without `url`; `url` + `secret` on the
    others; `enabled: false` registers nothing), resolves keyed schedules onto every declared
    environment, and emits `schedules.json` entries with `environment` and `forward`.
  - **api/servers**: a new `/api/cron-forward/<environment>/<endpointId>` route (secured by
    `CRON_SECRET`) pings the target environment with its own `CRON_SECRET` read from
    `LOWDEFY_SECRET_<secret name>` on the production deployment (fails closed when unset) and answers
    immediately; `/api/cron/*` honours the `x-lowdefy-cron-environment` header forwarded requests carry.
  - **cli**: `lowdefy vercel-output` registers forwarded schedules as `/api/cron-forward/...` cron jobs.

  Existing apps without `config.cron` are unaffected.

- 15956e0: feat: Production-grade Docker deployment.

  **Health endpoint (`@lowdefy/server`)**

  - The server now serves `GET /api/lowdefy-health` for container health checks and orchestrator probes. The endpoint skips auth, session lookup, request logging, and Sentry, so frequent probes stay out of logs.

  **Container-friendly startup and shutdown (`@lowdefy/server`)**

  - Startup and Sentry-enabled messages now log as structured JSON through pino instead of plain text, keeping stdout a uniform NDJSON stream for log collectors.
  - On SIGTERM/SIGINT the server closes websocket clients (code 1001, clients reconnect automatically), finishes in-flight requests, flushes pending Sentry events, and exits well within Docker's 10 second stop grace period.

  **New `docker-output` CLI command (`lowdefy` CLI)**

  - Assembles a minimal production runtime at `.lowdefy/docker` from a built app by tracing the server's runtime dependency graph (via `@vercel/nft`) and copying only the files the server imports. This drops the client-side block packages (already compiled into `dist/client`) and other unused dependencies from the image, cutting the shipped runtime to a fraction of the installed `node_modules`. Preserves pnpm workspace links so it works in monorepos.

  **Rewritten `init-docker` Dockerfile (`lowdefy` CLI)**

  - Pins the Lowdefy CLI to the app's `lowdefy:` version from `lowdefy.yaml`, so image builds are reproducible.
  - Runs `docker-output` after the build and copies the traced runtime into the image, so build tooling (Vite, `@lowdefy/build`, webpack) and unused runtime dependencies no longer ship in production.
  - Uses a BuildKit cache mount for the pnpm store, installs pnpm without corepack (removed from Node.js 25+), runs as the built-in non-root `node` user on `node:22-slim`, and adds a `HEALTHCHECK` against `/api/lowdefy-health`.
  - Fixed `init-docker` failing to write `.dockerignore` from the published package.

- e0a06a2: feat: Dynamic page content — server-resolved blocks at page load.

  Pages can now include a `Dynamic` block whose content is resolved on the server at page load by an api endpoint routine. The routine returns block config; the server builds and validates it, splices it into the page, and the client renders the result like any other page.

  **`Dynamic` block (`@lowdefy/blocks-basic`)**

  - New container block configured with `properties.endpointId`, static `params`, an optional `fallback` slot rendered when resolution fails, and `required: true` to fail the page load instead.
  - `properties.types` declares extra block, action and operator types the endpoint may return, so build includes them in the client bundle.

  **Server resolution (`@lowdefy/api`, `@lowdefy/server`, `@lowdefy/server-dev`)**

  - The endpoint is called in-process during page get with a payload of `{ params, pageId, blockId, urlQuery }` — the page request's query string is forwarded on both initial loads and SPA navigations.
  - Returned blocks are validated before reaching the client: types must be in the client bundle, block properties are checked against plugin schemas (operator values are exempt), and `Request` and `CallAPI` action references are verified.
  - Nested `Dynamic` blocks resolve recursively up to 5 levels; endpoint auth is enforced per resolution.
  - Client-evaluated operators in returned config are escaped with one extra underscore (`__state` → `_state`), the same deferral convention as `_function` args — a plain `_state` evaluates against the routine's own state.

  **Build (`@lowdefy/build`)**

  - Validates `Dynamic` block config, flags dynamic pages in the page artifact, and bundles declared types.
  - New `@lowdefy/build/dynamic` entry builds and validates runtime block config with the same pipeline as static pages.

  **Engine (`@lowdefy/engine`)**

  - Dynamic pages build a fresh context on every navigation, since the server may resolve different content per request.

- 742a900: feat: Email notification rendering

  Lowdefy apps can now define notifications in config: branded emails rendered from framework templates, delivered over any SMTP provider. The framework renders; storing and sending are composed in YAML routines — so any database works through its normal request types, and apps or modules own the notification record.

  **`notifications:` config section (`@lowdefy/build`, `@lowdefy/api`)**

  - New root section where the template is the type: `{ id, type, properties }` with per-notification `theme` overrides and `testData`
  - Template properties are nunjucks data templates — `{{ task.title }}` interpolates against the pipeline's data with no operator syntax; interpolated values are inert (can never inject markup or links)
  - New `RenderNotification` API routine step: renders one data item per call and returns `{ subject, title, preview, html, text, data }` where `data` is the link-resolved item — inserting the record, deduplicating, sending and updating send results are plain routine steps (`:for`, requests, `_uuid`)
  - New `app.email` theme settings (logo, companyName, primaryColor, signature, footer)
  - Link resolution is driven by the step's `serverUrl`, `landingPage` and `recordId` properties: `{ pageId, urlQuery }` links resolve to direct page URLs, or through a landing page (`?_id=<recordId>&option=<dotpath>`) that can mark the record read before redirecting (for example the modules-mongodb notifications module's link page)

  **Email templates (`@lowdefy/email-templates`)**

  - Three React Email templates: `NotificationEmail` (message, metadata table, quoted comment, CTA button, action list), `DigestEmail` (item roundups) and `AlertEmail` (status-toned notices)
  - Sections render only when configured; markdown in `message` with raw HTML disabled
  - Custom templates are plain React Email plugin packages under the new `notifications` type category

  **SMTP connection (`@lowdefy/connection-smtp`)**

  - New `SMTP` connection wrapping nodemailer — works with SES, Postmark, Mailgun, Resend and self-hosted servers; `SMTPMailSend` request type
  - Environment-aware delivery `filter` (`replaceAddress` catch-all, domain `allowlist`, `regex`) applied to every send

  **SendGrid (`@lowdefy/connection-sendgrid`)**

  - Supports the same delivery `filter` and default `replyTo`; interchangeable with SMTP wherever a routine sends notification emails
  - Array requests now send per message; request-level `templateId` is no longer overridden by an unset connection `templateId`

  **Preview CLI (`lowdefy`)**

  - New `lowdefy emails` command: builds the app, generates a preview per notification from its `testData`, and opens React Email's preview server; warns when a template data key is missing from `testData`

  Builds also now validate that `CallAgent` steps reference existing agents — previously this check existed but never ran, so broken agent references that used to build will now fail with a config error.

- 51c3008: feat: Endpoint execution controls for serverless deployments.

  - `config.vercel { maxDuration, memory }` in `lowdefy.yaml` flows into the generated Vercel function config (default stays 60s).
  - `async: true` on Api/InternalApi endpoints responds `{ accepted: true }` immediately and runs the routine in the background (kept alive via the platform request context; outcome observable through logs).
  - `detached: true` on CallApi steps fire-and-forgets the target through the new `POST /api/detached/<endpointId>` route (CRON_SECRET transport auth), running it in its own invocation with a fresh duration budget.
  - `webhook: true` on endpoints turns them into third-party webhook receivers on the standard `/api/endpoints` route: raw `{ body, query, headers }` payload, verbatim response body, system context — caller auth is the routine's first step. Non-webhook endpoints are unchanged.

- 596212a: feat: `lowdefy init-vercel` instruments an app for Vercel, plus a configurable request timeout.

  **`init-vercel`** now scaffolds a complete Vercel setup into `<config-directory>/deploy/`, so a v6
  Lowdefy app (Hono server + Vite client) deploys to Vercel as static assets on the CDN plus one
  Serverless Function:

  - `vercel.json` — serves the built client (`dist/client`, which includes the app's `public/` files
    via Vite's `publicDir`) from the CDN, sets the build command (`pnpm run build:client`) and output
    directory, rewrites all other requests to the function, bundles the runtime-read build artifacts
    via `includeFiles`, and caps the function with `maxDuration`.
  - `api/index.js` — a Node Serverless Function that `chdir`s to the deploy directory, builds a Web
    `Request` from the buffered Node request body, and runs the Hono app. (Vercel's Node runtime does
    not drain a lazily-read body stream, so a streaming adapter hangs on every request with a body.)
  - `vercel.install.sh` + `README.md`.

  **Request timeout.** `@lowdefy/server`'s `createApp` now bounds request duration with a `timeout`
  middleware, configured by a new **`config.requestTimeout`** (milliseconds) in `lowdefy.yaml`
  (default `30000`, `0` disables). This protects against requests that hang on an upstream call
  (database, SMTP, external API) running to the host's function limit — important on serverless
  platforms billed by duration. Agent streaming routes are exempt. `@lowdefy/build` adds
  `config.requestTimeout` to the schema.

  `createApp` also gains a `{ serveStaticAssets }` option (default `true`); the Vercel function passes
  `false` so the CDN owns static files and the function only handles dynamic routes. Docs updated
  (deployment/Vercel and the config reference).

- a858f8f: feat: MCP server exposing API endpoints as tools.

  - New root `mcp` config block (`name`, `version`, `endpoints`) — listed `Api` endpoints are served as MCP tools at `POST /api/mcp` over streamable HTTP.
  - Endpoint `description` and `payloadSchema` become the tool description and inputSchema; both are required for exposed endpoints, and `InternalApi` endpoints cannot be exposed.
  - Tool listing and calls are authorized per request with the caller's session; the build always writes an `mcp.json` artifact (`configured: false` when no endpoints are listed).

- 89a4c53: feat(server): Log response status and duration on every request.

  The server's per-request log line now fires after the response is finalized and includes `status` and `duration_ms`, turning it into a standard access log for production observability. Errored requests log their final status alongside the existing error detail line.

  Every log line now also carries the app's deploy identity — `app_name`, `app_version`, and `git_sha` (each omitted when not set) — so errors and access logs can be correlated to a specific build across replicas and rolling deploys. The Lowdefy version logs once on the startup line.

  The request id (`rid`) now honors an `x-request-id` header set by an upstream proxy or load balancer (validated, falling back to a generated UUID) and is echoed on the response `x-request-id` header, so one id correlates client, proxy, and server logs. Also fixed the access and error logs reading the misspelled `x-forward-for` header — client IPs behind proxies are now captured under `x-forwarded-for`.

- efd1967: feat: Add websockets — a first-class realtime primitive.

  Define channels under a new top-level `websockets:` key and subscribe pages to them with `subscriptions:` — live dashboards, notifications, and chat without polling or an external socket service. The same Lowdefy server that serves your pages pushes messages over a single multiplexed WebSocket connection, locally and on Vercel (native WebSocket support on Fluid compute). Authentication uses your existing session, with per-channel `auth.websockets` roles.

  **Channels (`websockets:`)**

  - Websocket types are plugins: `Channel` (client pub/sub relay) and `Interval` (timed ticks) ship in the new `@lowdefy/websockets-core` package; `MongoDBChangeStream` in `@lowdefy/connection-mongodb` pushes MongoDB change events to subscribed pages.
  - Channel `properties` are evaluated server-side per subscription — `_payload` and `_user` make channels user-specific. Subscribers with identical evaluated properties share one running source.

  **Page subscriptions (`subscriptions:`)**

  - Pages subscribe on mount and unsubscribe on navigation — no wiring needed.
  - React to messages with `onMessage`, `onSubscribe` and `onError` events, or read channel state anywhere with the new `_websocket` operator (`connected`, `messages`, `lastMessage`, `messageCount`, `error`).
  - Renders are throttled (`client.throttleRender`) and message history is bounded (`client.maxMessages`).

  **Actions**

  - New `Publish`, `Subscribe` and `Unsubscribe` actions in `@lowdefy/actions-core` — publish messages to a channel or control subscriptions dynamically.

  The client reconnects with backoff and resubscribes automatically, so serverless connection limits (e.g. Vercel function `maxDuration`) are invisible to users. See the new WebSockets section in the docs for a quick start.

### Patch Changes

- 082acec: chore: Bump `yaml` to 2.9.0, clearing vite's `yaml@^2.4.2` peer warning.
- 59190b5: Refresh dependencies and require Node.js 22 or newer.

  Updated a range of libraries across the project to current versions (including the MongoDB driver, the
  MQL/aggregation engine, and various build and CLI tooling) and set the minimum supported Node.js version
  to 22, matching what is tested in CI. Most changes are internal with no effect on your app. One small
  behaviour note: in `_mql` expressions, adding to a missing or null field now returns `null` (matching
  MongoDB) instead of `NaN`.

- da0c62c: chore: Update pino from 8.16.2 to 10.3.1.

  No behavior change — the log output format, levels, and configuration are unchanged. The pino 9 and 10 majors only drop support for Node.js versions below 20, and Lowdefy already requires Node.js 22 or newer.

- 6730996: feat: Provider-neutral file storage — upload and download files to S3-compatible providers, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.

  **Generic file blocks (`@lowdefy/blocks-files`, new)**

  - New `Upload`, `UploadPhoto`, `UploadDragger`, and `Download` blocks that work with any storage provider. Upload blocks call an upload-policy request by id (`uploadPolicyRequestId`) and support both POST form uploads (S3, R2, MinIO, GCS) and PUT body uploads (Azure SAS), with upload progress on both.
  - `emitFileContent: true` reads the file in the browser and emits `{ name, size, type, content }` (base64) as the block value and `onChange` event, for storing files through an API endpoint routine with a server-side write request.

  **S3-compatible providers (`@lowdefy/plugin-aws`)**

  - `AwsS3Bucket` connections accept `endpoint` and `forcePathStyle`, unlocking Cloudflare R2, MinIO, DigitalOcean Spaces, Backblaze B2, and Wasabi with a one-line config change.
  - `AwsS3PresignedGetObject` returns a stable, non-expiring public URL when the request sets `public: true`; the connection-level `publicUrlBase` overrides the constructed URL for CDN domains.
  - New `AwsS3PutObject` write and `AwsS3GetObject` read requests store and read base64 object content from endpoint routines or page requests, so routines can process file content in steps.
  - The `S3UploadButton`, `S3UploadPhoto`, `S3UploadDragger`, and `S3Download` blocks are now deprecated aliases of the generic blocks — existing apps keep working unchanged.

  **Google Cloud Storage (`@lowdefy/plugin-gcp`, new)**

  - `GoogleCloudStorageBucket` connection with `GcsSignedPostPolicy`, `GcsSignedGetUrl`, `GcsGetObject`, and `GcsPutObject` requests.

  **Azure Blob Storage (`@lowdefy/plugin-azure`, new)**

  - `AzureBlobContainer` connection with `AzureBlobUploadSas`, `AzureBlobDownloadSas`, `AzureBlobGet`, and `AzureBlobPut` requests.

  **Editor and chat uploads (`@lowdefy/blocks-tiptap`, `@lowdefy/blocks-antd-x`)**

  - Tiptap editors and AgentChat attachments now upload through the shared provider-neutral flow. New `uploadPolicyRequestId` and `downloadPolicyRequestId` properties replace `s3PostPolicyRequestId` (kept as a deprecated alias). Inline image and attachment URLs resolve through the download request when configured.

  **Servers (`@lowdefy/server`, `@lowdefy/server-dev`)**

  - `/api/endpoints/*` request bodies are capped at 10 MiB (matching the agent route), bounding base64 file payloads sent via `CallAPI`.

  **Codemod (`@lowdefy/codemods`)**

  - Optional `s3-blocks-to-file-blocks` codemod renames the deprecated S3\* blocks and `s3PostPolicyRequestId`/`s3GetPolicyRequestId` properties to the provider-neutral names via `lowdefy upgrade`.

## 5.6.0

### Patch Changes

- 8306262: feat(blocks-aggrid): Add `AgGridLowdefy`, upgrade to AG Grid v33, and theme every grid through the Theming API.

  **Two new blocks.** `AgGridLowdefy` (display) and `AgGridLowdefyInput` (input) are grids themed from the app's antd design tokens — primary colour, surfaces, fonts and radius — so they look like they belong in a Lowdefy app and follow light/dark mode automatically, with no configuration and no separate dark block. They take a `size` property (`small | middle | large`, default `middle`) mirroring antd Table's densities, which sets row and header height to 36 / 44 / 54 pixels. Everything else — properties, events, methods, cell renderers — is identical to the existing grids.

  To adopt, change `type: AgGridBalham` to `type: AgGridLowdefy` (or `type: AgGridInputBalham` to `type: AgGridLowdefyInput`). Every property carries over unchanged and the grid will deliberately look different afterwards. It is a visual opt-in, so there is no codemod.

  Note that `size` loses to an explicit height: `rowHeight` and `headerHeight` are AG Grid grid options, and a grid option beats the theme parameter `size` sets. Setting `size: large` alongside `rowHeight: 30` gives 30 pixel rows under a 54 pixel header — use one or the other.

  **AG Grid v33.** The package moves from `@ag-grid-community/*@32` to `ag-grid-community` + `ag-grid-react@33.3.2`, with `AllCommunityModule` registered explicitly. The Theming API is v33's default and class-based file themes are gone, so no block imports AG Grid CSS any more.

  **The Balham, Alpine and Material blocks change appearance slightly.** They are kept indefinitely with the same API and the same names, but they now render AG Grid's prebuilt Theming API equivalents of those themes, with the antd colour mapping carried across as theme parameters. No config change is needed. What shifts:

  - Spacing and header weight move a little — Balham rows go 28px to 29px, cell horizontal padding tightens on Balham and Alpine, the wrapper corner radius now comes from each theme (Balham 2px, Alpine 3px, Material 0) rather than a uniform 6px, and Balham's header weight goes from 600 to bold. Icons come from each theme's own SVG set, so glyph shapes differ from the old icon font.
  - Row height now tracks the app's antd font size on Balham and Material, because v33 derives it from the data font size. It was font-size-independent before. The height only moves once the font size passes the theme's icon size (16px on Balham, 18px on Material), so at antd's default 14px nothing changes — you will see it at 18px or 20px. Alpine is unaffected at any font size.
  - Four colours are re-pointed: row hover is a neutral fill rather than a primary tint, borders are lighter, the checkbox outline tone changes, and popup shadows are softer.
  - Zebra striping, fonts and overall row density are preserved.

  **A new `themeParams` property, on all eight blocks.** `themeParams` takes AG Grid Theming API parameter names and merges them onto the block's theme — the recommended way to retint a single grid:

  ```yaml
  - id: my_table
    type: AgGridLowdefy
    properties:
      themeParams:
        headerBackgroundColor: '#1a1a2e'
        headerTextColor: '#e0e0ff'
        borderColor: var(--ant-color-primary)
  ```

  Values are CSS strings and may reference antd tokens. Neither Lowdefy nor AG Grid validates parameter names, so a misspelled key is a silent no-op — check spelling against AG Grid's theming parameter reference.

  Overriding `--ag-*` variables through a block's `style` — the documented `custom_theme` technique — **still works**; the Theming API honours an ancestor's declaration by design. The one caveat is that v33 renamed or folded away a number of the v32 `--ag-*` variables, and an override naming one of those is now a silent no-op. `--ag-header-foreground-color`, which appears in the documented example, is the case to watch: it is now `headerTextColor` (`--ag-header-text-color`). The AgGrid docs page carries the mapping table.

  **One deprecation warning existing apps may see.** `rowSelection: multiple` / `single` is deprecated in v33 in favour of `rowSelection: { mode: multiRow }` / `{ mode: singleRow }`. The string form still works. If you migrate it, three things must move together:

  - **Set `enableClickSelection: true`.** The string form defaults click-to-select on; the object form defaults it **off**. A bare `{ mode: singleRow }` silently stops clicking a row from selecting it, and `onRowSelected` / `onSelectionChanged` stop firing. The object form is not equivalent without this.
  - **Move the colDef flags in the same edit.** `checkboxSelection` and `headerCheckboxSelection` on a column become `rowSelection.checkboxes` and `rowSelection.headerCheckbox`. v33 only supports `headerCheckboxSelection` alongside the _string_ form, so migrating one without the other breaks the header checkbox.
  - **Six sibling options are read only in the string branch and are silently lost on migration:** `suppressRowClickSelection`, `suppressRowDeselection`, `rowMultiSelectWithClick`, `groupSelectsChildren`, `groupSelectsFiltered` and `isRowSelectable`. All six are deprecated in favour of `rowSelection.*` — move any you use across.

  **Dark-mode apps now get dark browser chrome throughout (`@lowdefy/client`, `@lowdefy/server`, `@lowdefy/server-dev`, `@lowdefy/server-e2e`).** `color-scheme` is now set on `<html>` from the resolved dark-mode state — in the client's dark-mode effect and in each server's pre-hydration inline script, so first paint matches too. Native scrollbars, `<select>` dropdowns, date pickers and autofill backgrounds render dark in a dark app, inside grids and everywhere else. This is an app-wide behaviour change, well beyond AgGrid, and it is what lets the grid's own scrollbars follow dark mode. Apps pinned to light with `theme.darkMode: light` are unaffected, including on a dark OS. Apps that leave `theme.darkMode` unset get the default, `system`, so on a dark OS they resolve to dark and do pick up `color-scheme: dark` — set `theme.darkMode: light` if that is not wanted.

- 79bbd84: fix(api): Redact server internals from every client-bound error, not just the 500 response.

  Errors sent to a browser or an API caller now have `received` and `stack` stripped at
  **every** level of the error, and a non-`Error` `cause` dropped unless the error is a
  `UserError`. Two live leaks are closed:

  - The 500 handlers stripped fields from the outermost error only, so `cause.stack` — and
    the absolute server paths in its frames — reached production browsers.
  - An endpoint result body (`callEndpoint` and the agent route) and a request response body
    (`callRequest`) were not redacted at all. They carried `received`, which on the request
    path holds the **evaluated** request properties, so a `_secret` resolved into a request
    header crossed the wire at HTTP 200.

  `source` is now guaranteed config-relative (`pages/home.yaml:5`, never `/var/task/...`),
  and `configKey` is kept again: the browser deduplicates errors on `message:configKey`, so
  stripping it collapsed two different errors that happened to share a message and silently
  dropped the second.

  **Breaking for app config that reads `error.received`.** Server-originated errors no longer
  carry it, so `_actions` and `_request_details` expose `received` as `undefined`, and the
  browser console no longer prints the `Received: <json>` line for them. This is deliberate —
  the field can contain your own resolved secrets. The error `message` is unchanged, and
  server logs still record `received` and `stack` in full in every environment, including dev.

  Also fixes internal errors being logged twice. A `LowdefyInternalError` never gets a
  `source`, and the browser used `source` to decide whether the server had already logged an
  error, so it POSTed every internal error back to `/api/client-error` for a second log. The
  browser now reads the `handled` flag the server sets when it logs.

### Minor Changes

- 60401aa: feat: Add `_app` operator and structured app metadata.

  A new runtime operator `_app` reads the app's declared metadata —
  `slug`, `name`, `version`, `description`, `license`, `lowdefyVersion`,
  `gitSha`. It works on both client and server, including inside
  `modules-mongodb` request filters, and inside `_js` functions via a
  bound `lowdefyApp(p)` callable.

  The root `lowdefy.yaml` schema gains two new optional fields:

  - `slug` — a kebab-case identifier (`^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`),
    validated at build time. Build fails with a clear error if invalid.
  - `description` — a free-form string.

  `gitSha` resolves through a fallback chain: `LOWDEFY_GIT_SHA` env var
  when set non-empty → `git rev-parse HEAD` → `null`. This lets apps
  deployed without `.git` (Docker, Vercel, Netlify, Render, hermetic
  PaaS sandboxes) pin the SHA explicitly by mapping their platform's
  commit env var via shell expansion in the build command.

  Build emits a new `appMeta.json` artifact alongside `app.json`. The
  existing `app.git_sha` field is removed; consumers (internal telemetry)
  read `gitSha` from `appMeta` instead.

  See the `_app` operator reference for the full key set and examples.

- f11addd: feat: Extend i18n coverage to Lowdefy agents.

  Builds on the i18n / locale support from
  `feat-i18n-locale-support.md`. End-user-visible strings in the agent
  runtime and the `AgentChat` block now localize automatically when
  `config.i18n` is configured.

  **Agent runtime errors.** HTTP 4xx/5xx responses from the agent
  endpoint (`Only POST requests are supported.`, `Invalid agent path`,
  `Agent "X" does not exist.`, `Agent type "Y" can not be found.`,
  `Endpoint execution failed`, etc.) translate per request via the
  `Accept-Language` header against `agent.runtime.*` builtin keys.

  **AgentChat block UI.** Framework-rendered strings in the chat UI go
  through `methods.translate` against new `agent.*` builtin keys:

  - `agent.sender.placeholder` — `'Type a message...'`
  - `agent.toolApproval.{approve,reject}` — `'Approve'` / `'Reject'`
  - `agent.message.{copy,feedback,regenerate,delete}` — message actions
  - `agent.toolResult.{completed,completedNoData,empty,emptyList,showMore,showLess}` — tool result captions

  Override per locale via `config.i18n.messages.{locale}` — same
  mechanism as any other built-in message.

  **antd X locale wiring.** The app shell now uses
  `@ant-design/x@2.7.x`'s `XProvider` at the root (drop-in superset of
  antd's `ConfigProvider`) with a merged antd + antd-X locale pack.
  antd X ships only `en_US` and `zh_CN` packs; other locales fall back
  to `en_US` for X-native strings (`'New chat'`, `'Stop loading'`,
  `'Like'`/`'Dislike'`, bubble edit `'OK'`/`'Cancel'`). Apps can
  override these in unsupported locales via the new `agent.antdx.*`
  reference keys.

  **Plugin-author surface.** Agent hook endpoints (`onStart`,
  `onStepStart`, `onToolCallStart`, `onToolCallFinish`, `onStepFinish`,
  `onFinish`) now receive `locale: <activeCode>` in their payload, so
  hook routines can branch on the user's locale.

  **System prompt translation.** `agent.properties.instructions` passes
  through the operator parser at request time — `_t:` works there for
  locale-aware system prompts.

  ```yaml
  agents:
    - id: assistant
      type: AISDKAgent
      connectionId: anthropic
      properties:
        agent:
          model: claude-sonnet-4
          instructions:
            _t: agent.systemPrompt
  ```

  **What stays English** (explicit choices):

  - Built-in tool descriptions used in the model prompt (English-trained
    models perform best with English tool descriptions).
  - Build-time agent validation errors (developer diagnostics).
  - Console warnings (ops diagnostics).
  - The `[File truncated — showing first NKB...]` notice in the
    `read-file` built-in tool (model-facing).
  - Model-streamed natural-language output (owned by the model).

- 0108f38: feat: First-class i18n / locale support for Lowdefy apps.

  Apps can now declare supported locales and message catalogs under
  `config.i18n`, switch language at runtime, and translate their own
  strings with ICU MessageFormat. Ant Design's component strings (date
  pickers, modal Ok/Cancel, pagination, form validation messages),
  dayjs date formatting, and the engine's built-in framework strings
  (loading toasts, validation summaries, popup blocker warnings, error
  page) all localize automatically once `config.i18n` is set.

  ```yaml
  config:
    i18n:
      defaultLocale: en-US
      locales:
        - { code: en-US, label: English, antd: en_US, dayjs: en }
        - { code: de-DE, label: Deutsch, antd: de_DE, dayjs: de }
      messages:
        en-US: { greeting: 'Hello, {name}!' }
        de-DE: { greeting: 'Hallo, {name}!' }
  ```

  **New schema** — `config.i18n` with `defaultLocale`, `locales[]`, and
  `messages`. Validated at build time; only declared locales are bundled
  (antd and dayjs locale imports are codegen'd, no ~150KB unused). The
  missing-key fallback is always `en-US`, so plugin and module authors
  should ship `en-US` translations as a baseline.

  **New operators**

  - [`_t`](/_t) — translate operator with ICU MessageFormat. Resolution
    order: active locale → fallback locale → built-in framework message
    → key.

    ```yaml
    _t:
      key: cart.items
      values: { count: { _state: itemCount } }
    ```

  - [`_locale`](/_locale) — read `active` / `default` / `fallback`
    (always `'en-US'`) / `supported` locale state. Use with `Selector`
    to build a language picker.

  **New action** — [`SetLocale`](/SetLocale) sets the user's preferred
  locale (persisted to `localStorage`). Pass `'auto'` to clear the
  preference and fall back to the browser language or default.

  **Built-in framework strings.** Engine and client strings (`'Loading'`,
  `'Success'`, `'This field is required'`, validation summaries, popup
  blocker, error page) live in a built-in catalog and surface as English
  by default. Authors override per-locale by adding the same key to
  `config.i18n.messages`:

  ```yaml
  messages:
    de-DE:
      engine.action.loading: 'Laden'
      engine.validation.fieldRequired: 'Pflichtfeld'
  ```

  See the [Internationalization concept page](/i18n) for the full list
  of overridable keys.

  **Ant Design block cleanup.** `Modal`/`ConfirmModal` `okText`/`cancelText`
  and date picker placeholders (`DateSelector`, `DateRangeSelector`,
  `DateTimeSelector`, `MonthSelector`, `WeekSelector`) no longer hardcode
  English defaults — they fall through to antd's `ConfigProvider locale`,
  so a German app gets `'OK'` / `'Abbrechen'` / `'Datum auswählen'`
  without per-block configuration. The antd `ConfigProvider` block
  itself now accepts a `locale` prop for subtree overrides.

  **Server-side translation.** API requests resolve the user's active
  locale from the `Accept-Language` header and thread it into the server
  operator parser, so `_t` works the same in server-side actions and
  requests as on the client.

  **Translation engine.** A new `translate()` helper in `@lowdefy/helpers`
  backs both the `_t` operator and the engine/client adapter (installed
  on `lowdefy._internal.translate`). One source of truth for the lookup
  chain; no duplication. Adds `intl-messageformat` as a foundational dep.

  **Plugin-author surface.** Action and block plugins receive
  `methods.translate(key, values)` and `methods.getLocale()` for runtime
  translation in their JS code. Plugin packages can ship default
  messages via a `./messages` export — the build merges them into the
  app's i18n catalog (user app messages > plugin messages > framework
  builtins > key).

  **DatePicker and NumberInput auto-localization.** Date selector blocks
  (`DateSelector`, `DateRangeSelector`, `DateTimeSelector`,
  `MonthSelector`) and `NumberInput` derive their default `format` /
  `decimalSeparator` from the active locale via `Intl.DateTimeFormat` /
  `Intl.NumberFormat`. A German user sees `DD.MM.YYYY` and `1234,56`
  automatically; an en-US user sees `MM/DD/YYYY` and `1234.56`.

### Patch Changes

- d1fb1d7: feat: Plugin-driven `serverExternalPackages` for Next.js.

  Plugins can now declare which of their dependencies need to be passed
  through to Next.js's `serverExternalPackages` config — used for CJS
  packages whose runtime `require()` chains Turbopack can't resolve
  through pnpm's isolated symlink layout (e.g. `turndown` →
  `@mixmark-io/domino`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3` → `fast-xml-parser` →
  `strnum`).

  Declare in the plugin's `package.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "lowdefy": {
      "serverExternalPackages": ["turndown"]
    }
  }
  ```

  Build aggregates declarations from every plugin the app actually uses
  (across blocks, connections, operators, actions, agents, auth, icons,
  requests) and writes a per-app `serverExternalPackages.json` artifact,
  read by `server`, `server-dev`, and `server-e2e` Next.js configs.

  Replaces a hardcoded list in the three server configs. Apps not using
  `blocks-tiptap` or `plugin-aws` no longer carry their externals.

  Initial declarations:

  - `@lowdefy/blocks-tiptap` → `turndown`
  - `@lowdefy/plugin-aws` → `@aws-sdk/client-s3`

## 5.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 0f38c9f: feat: First-class module system for reusable config packages

  Modules are reusable bundles of Lowdefy config — pages, connections, API endpoints, menus, and exposed components — hosted in GitHub repositories or local directories. Apps install modules in `lowdefy.yaml` and configure them through `vars`, replacing the copy-paste-between-projects pattern with a declarative dependency.

  **Module entries (`@lowdefy/build`)**

  - Apps declare entries in the `modules` array of `lowdefy.yaml` with `id`, `source`, and optional `vars`, `connections`, and `dependencies`.
  - The entry `id` namespaces the module's content and forms the URL prefix for its pages (e.g. `/team-users/users-list`).
  - Multi-instance: the same module source can be installed multiple times under different entry IDs, each with its own vars and namespace.
  - GitHub sources (`github:owner/repo[/path]@ref`) are fetched as tarballs and locally cached. Private repos use `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the `gh` CLI, or git credential helpers.
  - Local sources (`file:./relative/path`) resolve relative to the project root.

  **Module manifest (`module.lowdefy.yaml`)**

  - Declares the module's interface: `name`, `description`, `vars`, `connections`, `pages`, `api`, `components`, `menus`, `dependencies`, `exports`, `plugins`, and `secrets`.
  - `vars` declarations validate consumer values with `type`, `required`, `default`, and `description`. Consumer values override manifest defaults; omitted values fall back to the declared default.
  - `exports` declares the module's public interface — the IDs other modules and apps may reference. The build validates cross-module references against exports.
  - `plugins` declarations are validated against the app's installed plugins with semver compatibility checks.
  - `secrets` is an allowlist of secrets the module may access; undeclared `_secret` references fail the build. Remapped connections skip the module's secret references for that connection.

  **Module operators**

  - `_module.var` — read manifest-validated vars, including consumer overrides and declared defaults.
  - `_module.pageId`, `_module.connectionId`, `_module.endpointId` — produce scoped IDs from a module-author's unscoped ID.
  - `_module.id` — the entry ID of the current module.

  **Auto-scoped IDs**

  Page, connection, API endpoint, and menu item IDs are auto-prefixed with the entry ID. Block and request IDs inherit page scope and are not rewritten.

  **Consuming module resources**

  - Pages and APIs are auto-included and auto-scoped — they appear in the app under the entry-ID prefix.
  - Components are reusable config fragments included with `_ref: { module, component, vars }`. They can export any config — UI blocks, enum maps, config templates, schema fragments — and accept vars at the call site.
  - Menus are included with `_ref: { module, menu }`, typically wrapped in a `MenuGroup`.

  **Connection remapping**

  Apps can redirect a module connection to an existing app connection via the entry's `connections` map. The module's connection definition and its declared secrets are skipped — the app connection handles them.

  **Cross-module dependencies**

  Modules can reference each other's pages, components, menus, connections, and APIs via abstract dependencies declared in `module.lowdefy.yaml`.

  - Auto-wiring: when a module entry's `id` matches a declared dependency name, the build wires it automatically.
  - Explicit wiring: the entry's `dependencies` map overrides auto-wiring and supports multi-instance topologies where each instance points at a different partner.
  - The build validates every wiring, detects dependency cycles, and reports unmapped or undeclared dependencies with remediation hints.

  **Auth page rules**

  Picomatch glob patterns in auth page rules (e.g. `team-users/*`) for wildcard module page matching.

  **Slashed page IDs (`@lowdefy/server`, `@lowdefy/server-dev`)**

  Server routes support module page IDs containing `/` (e.g. `/team-users/users-list`).

### Patch Changes

- 596fddc: chore(connection-knex): update knex and SQL drivers; replace `sqlite3` with `better-sqlite3`; replace `mysql` with `mysql2`.

  Bumped knex and its dialect drivers, and consolidated onto the actively-maintained drivers — replaced `sqlite3` with `better-sqlite3` and `mysql` with `mysql2`. Subsumes the prior `sqlite3@5.1.7` darwin-arm64 fix.

  `@lowdefy/connection-knex` dependency changes:

  - `knex` `2.5.1` → `3.2.9`. Knex 3.x drops Node < 16; Lowdefy already requires Node 18+. The `knex(config)`, `.raw()`, and dynamic query-builder API surface used by `KnexRaw` / `KnexBuilder` is unchanged.
  - `pg` `8.11.3` → `8.20.0`.
  - **Removed** `mssql`. Knex's `mssql` dialect actually requires `tedious` (not the `mssql` package), and Lowdefy never imported `mssql` directly — it was only ever a vehicle for pulling tedious into the install tree. `client: mssql` in user YAML is unchanged: the knex client name stays the same, only the underlying npm package shipped with `connection-knex` changes.
  - **Added** `tedious` `19.2.1` as the SQL Server driver — the package knex actually loads when `client: mssql` is used.
  - **Removed** `sqlite3`. The driver is in maintenance-only mode upstream (the v6 release marked the repo unmaintained).
  - **Added** `better-sqlite3` `12.9.0` as the SQLite driver. Selectable as `client: better-sqlite3` (or `client: sqlite`, which is now an alias of `better-sqlite3` — see runtime client handling below).
  - **Removed** `mysql`. Unmaintained upstream since 2020.
  - **Added** `mysql2` `3.22.3` as the MySQL / MariaDB driver. Selectable as `client: mysql2` in connection YAML.

  Runtime client handling (in `createKnex`):

  - `client: sqlite` is silently remapped to `client: better-sqlite3`. `sqlite` was historically a knex-level alias of `sqlite3`; this preserves the YAML alias while the underlying driver changes.
  - `client: sqlite3` now throws a `ConfigError` with a migration message: `Knex connection "client: sqlite3" is no longer supported. Use "client: better-sqlite3" or "client: sqlite" instead.` Existing apps using `client: sqlite3` need to update their connection YAML.
  - `client: mysql` now throws a `ConfigError` with a migration message: `Knex connection "client: mysql" is no longer supported. Use "client: mysql2" instead.` Existing apps using `client: mysql` need to update their connection YAML. `mysql` is **not** silently remapped because knex treats `mysql` and `mysql2` as separate dialects with subtly different SQL formatters, not aliases — the migration is a deliberate user choice.

  `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` allowlist for `better-sqlite3`:

  `better-sqlite3` runs a native-binding install script (`prebuild-install` with a `node-gyp rebuild` fallback). pnpm 10 silently suppresses postinstall scripts for unapproved packages, which leaves the binding unbuilt and crashes `KnexRaw` / `KnexBuilder` at runtime.

  - Added `better-sqlite3` to the allowlist on `@lowdefy/server`, `@lowdefy/server-dev`, and `@lowdefy/server-e2e`. These are the install roots in the CLI fetch flow under `.lowdefy/{dev,build}/`, where pnpm honors the per-package `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` field.
  - Also added the same allowlist to the monorepo root `package.json`. The per-package field is ignored at workspace-root install (pnpm 10 only honors it on the install root), so contributors running `pnpm install` at the repo root would otherwise have to `pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3` manually.

## 5.1.0

### Patch Changes

- 081d79634: feat(client): Per-mode theme tokens for dark/light customization.

  `theme.antd` now accepts four new sibling keys so apps can soften base surfaces without juggling two theme files. Each is merged on top of the shared equivalent only when the matching mode is active:

  - `lightToken` / `darkToken` — override antd design tokens (e.g. `colorBgLayout`, `colorBgContainer`, `colorBgElevated`) per mode.
  - `lightComponents` / `darkComponents` — override component-level tokens per mode (e.g. `Layout.siderBg`, `Layout.headerBg`, `Menu.darkItemBg`) that aren't reachable via seed tokens.

  The `<html>` pre-hydration inline script now reads `darkToken.colorBgLayout` / `lightToken.colorBgLayout` from the built theme, so the first paint matches your configured surface color with no flash of `#000` or `#fff`.

  ```yaml
  theme:
    antd:
      token:
        colorPrimary: '#6366f1'
      darkToken:
        colorBgLayout: '#131419'
        colorBgContainer: '#1a1b22'
      darkComponents:
        Layout:
          headerBg: '#0e0f13'
          siderBg: '#0e0f13'
        Menu:
          darkItemBg: '#0e0f13'
          darkItemSelectedBg: '#252731'
    darkMode: system
  ```

  Backwards compatible — apps that only use `theme.antd.token` keep antd's default base colors (dark `#000`, light browser-default).

- f56a47d87: fix(server): Prevent white flash on page navigation in dark mode.

  Pages no longer flash white when navigating between pages in dark mode. A synchronous inline script now sets the correct background color before the page paints, matching the user's dark mode preference from config, localStorage, or system settings.

- c6f45a1ac: fix(server): Escape theme values embedded in the pre-hydration inline script.

  `_document.js` interpolates `configColorMode`, `darkToken.colorBgLayout`, and `lightToken.colorBgLayout` from `theme.json` into a synchronous `<script>` block to set the `<html>` background before hydration. Previously the values went through `JSON.stringify` only — enough to escape JS-string-context characters, but not enough to prevent a value containing `</script>` (or U+2028 / U+2029 line separators) from breaking out of the enclosing `<script>` tag.

  Added a `safeScriptJson` helper that additionally escapes `<`, `>`, control chars, and U+2028 / U+2029 to `\uXXXX` sequences after `JSON.stringify`. For every valid color value (`#1e293b`, `rgb(...)`, `slategray`, `oklch(...)`, etc.) the output is byte-identical to the previous behavior; only payloads that would have tripped `<script>` breakout or JS-line-terminator injection are now neutralized.

  Closes the six `js/bad-code-sanitization` CodeQL alerts (89 – 94) opened against the per-mode-theme PR.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- f430f02dde: Upgrade Next.js to 16 with Turbopack.

  ### Breaking Changes

  - **Next.js 16**: Both production and development servers run on Next.js 16 with Turbopack as the default bundler.
  - **Less removed**: `next-with-less` wrapper is removed. Styling uses CSS Modules and antd CSS-in-JS.
  - **SWC 1.15.18**: Updated SWC compiler.
  - **Dynamic transpilePackages**: Server resolves block packages for transpilation from a build artifact, supporting custom block plugins with CSS imports.
  - **antd as direct server dependency**: Both server packages list `antd` and `@ant-design/cssinjs` as direct dependencies for pnpm strict mode compatibility.

### Minor Changes

- c8f4a41063: Add `theme.darkMode` config with system preference support.

  **System Dark Mode (`theme.darkMode`)**

  - New `theme.darkMode` config key accepts `'system'` (default), `'light'`, or `'dark'`
  - When set to `'system'`, the app follows the OS dark mode preference and updates live when it changes
  - When set to `'light'` or `'dark'`, the developer locks the mode — user preferences are stored but not applied

  **SetDarkMode Action**

  - Now accepts string params: `darkMode: 'system' | 'light' | 'dark'`
  - Without params, cycles through light, dark, and system preferences

  **`_media` Operator**

  - New `_media: darkModePreference` returns the user's preference (`'system'`, `'light'`, or `'dark'`)
  - `_media: darkMode` continues to return the effective boolean state

  **Dark Mode Rendering**

  - Notification, Message, and ConfirmModal render with correct dark mode colors via `App.useApp()` hooks
  - Loader blocks (Skeleton, Spinner) use antd design tokens instead of hardcoded colors
  - 404 page and loading states use theme-aware backgrounds
  - Mobile menu drawer background matches the active theme

- f430f02dde: Add theme token system. Use `_theme` operator to access Ant Design v6 design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) at runtime. Theme is configured via `theme.antd.token` and `theme.antd.algorithm` in `lowdefy.yaml`. The `_theme` operator resolves the full computed token set including antd defaults.

### Patch Changes

- 30616048d: fix: Fix dev server build hang when page files contain top-level \_ref.

  The dev server could hang indefinitely at "Building config..." when a page YAML file's entire content was a `_ref`. This caused a self-referencing parent in the ref map, leading to an infinite loop during page source resolution. Also fixed null `lowdefy.yaml` handling in custom plugin type map generation.

### Minor Changes

- aa0d6d363e: feat: Config-aware error tracing and Sentry integration

  **Config-Aware Error Tracing (#1940)**

  - Errors now trace back to exact YAML config locations with file:line
  - Clickable VSCode links in terminal and browser
  - Build-time validation catches typos with "Did you mean?" suggestions
  - Service vs Config error classification

  **Plugin Error Refactoring**

  - Operators throw simple error messages without formatting
  - Parsers (WebParser, ServerParser, BuildParser) format errors with received value and location
  - Removed redundant "Operator Error:" prefix from error messages
  - Consistent error format: "{message} Received: {params} at {location}."
  - Actions and connections also simplified: removed inline `received` from error messages (interface layer adds it)
  - Connection plugins (axios-http, knex, redis, sendgrid) no longer expose raw response data in errors

  **Error Class Hierarchy**

  - Unified error system in `@lowdefy/errors` with all error classes
    - `@lowdefy/errors/build` - Build-time classes with sync location resolution
  - Error classes: `LowdefyError`, `ConfigError`, `ConfigWarning`, `PluginError`, `ServiceError`
  - `ConfigWarning` supports `prodError` flag to throw in production builds
  - `ServiceError.isServiceError()` detects network/timeout/5xx errors
  - `~ignoreBuildChecks` cascades through descendants to suppress warnings/errors

  **Build Error Collection**

  - Errors collected in `context.errors[]` instead of throwing immediately
  - `tryBuildStep()` wrapper catches and collects errors from build steps
  - All errors logged together before summary message for proper ordering

  **Sentry Integration (#1945)**

  - Zero-config Sentry support - just set SENTRY_DSN
  - Client and server error capture with Lowdefy context (pageId, blockId, config location)
  - Configurable sampling rates, session replay, user feedback
  - Graceful no-op when DSN not set

### Patch Changes

- aa0d6d363e: fix: Add missing uuid dependency to servers
- af61715d5: feat: JIT page building for dev server

  **Shallow Refs and JIT Build (`@lowdefy/build`)**

  - Shallow `_ref` resolution stops at configured JSON paths, leaving `~shallow` markers for on-demand resolution
  - `shallowBuild` produces a page registry with dependency tracking instead of fully built pages
  - `buildPageJit` fully resolves a single page on demand using the shallow build output
  - File dependency map tracks which config files affect which pages for targeted rebuilds
  - Build package reorganized: `jit/` folder for dev-server-only files, `full/` folder for production-only files

  **JIT Page Building (`@lowdefy/server-dev`)**

  - Pages are built on-demand when requested instead of all at once during initial build
  - Page cache with file-watcher invalidation for fast rebuilds
  - `/api/page/[pageId]` endpoint triggers JIT build if page not cached
  - `/api/js/[env]` endpoint serves operator JS maps
  - Build error page component displays errors inline in the browser

  **Operator JS Hash Check (`@lowdefy/operators-js`)**

  - Added hash validation for jsMap to detect stale operator definitions
