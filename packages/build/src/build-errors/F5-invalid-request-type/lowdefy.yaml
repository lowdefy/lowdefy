# F5: Invalid Request Type
# =========================
# Tests that using an undefined request type throws an error with a suggestion.
#
# Expected error:
#   [Config Error] Request type "AxiosHtt" was used but is not defined.
#   Did you mean "AxiosHttp"?
#
# The error points to line 22 where the request with invalid type is defined.
