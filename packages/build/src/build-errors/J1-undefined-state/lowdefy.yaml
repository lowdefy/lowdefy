# J1: Undefined State Reference
# ==============================
# Tests that _state references to undefined keys warn in dev mode.
# State keys are created from input block ids.
#
# Expected warning:
#   [Config Warning] _state references "undefinedKey" on page "home",
#   but no input block with id "undefinedKey" exists.
#
# The error points to line 19 where the _state operator is used.
