# F4: Request ID with Period
# ===========================
# Tests that request ids containing periods throw an error with location.
# Periods are reserved for path notation in _request operator.
#
# Expected error:
#   [Config Error] Request id "my.request" should not include a period (".").
#
# The error points to line 22 where the request with period in id is defined.
