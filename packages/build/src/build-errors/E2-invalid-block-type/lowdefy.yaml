# E2: Invalid Block Type
# =======================
# Tests that using an undefined block type throws an error with a suggestion.
#
# Expected error:
#   [Config Error] Block type "Buton" was used but is not defined.
#   Did you mean "Button"?
#
# The error points to line 16 where the invalid block is defined.
