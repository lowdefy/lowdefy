# H1: Operator Typo (_staet)
# ===========================
# Tests that unknown operators throw an error with a "Did you mean?" suggestion.
# This example uses "_staet" which is a typo for "_state".
#
# Expected warning:
#   [Config Error] Operator type "_staet" was used but is not defined.
#   Did you mean "_state"?
#
# The error points to line 19 where the operator is used.
