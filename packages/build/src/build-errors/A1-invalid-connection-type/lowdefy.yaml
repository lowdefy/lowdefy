# A1: Invalid Connection Type
# ============================
# Tests that using an undefined connection type throws an error with location.
#
# Expected error:
#   [Config Error] Connection type "NonExistentConnection" was used but is not defined.
#   Did you mean "AxiosHttp"?
#
# The error points to line 13 where the invalid connection is defined.
