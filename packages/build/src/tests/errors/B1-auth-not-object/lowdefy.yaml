# B1: Auth Not Object
# ====================
# Tests that auth config must be an object, not a primitive value.
#
# Expected error:
#   [Config Error] lowdefy.auth is not an object.
#
# Note: Primitive values don't have their own ~k metadata, so the error
# points to the parent object (root) at line 10.
