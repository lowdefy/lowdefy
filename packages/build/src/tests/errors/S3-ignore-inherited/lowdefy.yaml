# S3: Inherited Suppression from Parent
# ======================================
# Tests that ~ignoreBuildChecks cascades to children.
#
# The page has ~ignoreBuildChecks: true which should suppress warnings
# for all blocks within the page.
#
# Expected: NO warning for the child block's undefined _state reference.
