# J2: Undefined State Reference with ~ignoreBuildCheck
# =====================================================
# Tests that _state reference warnings are suppressed with ~ignoreBuildCheck: true.
# The ~ignoreBuildCheck flag is on the same object as the operator.
#
# Expected: NO warning should be shown.
