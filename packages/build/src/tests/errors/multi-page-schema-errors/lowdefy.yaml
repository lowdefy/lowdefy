# Multi-Page Schema Errors Test
# Tests that multiple schema errors across pages are ALL collected.
# Schema validation runs before buildPages, so these are caught in testSchema.
#
# Page 1: Missing block id (schema error)
# Page 2: Missing block id (schema error)
# Page 3: Missing block id (schema error)
#
# Expected behavior: ALL schema errors should be collected and reported together.
