# E1: Invalid Action Type
# ========================
# Tests that using an undefined action type throws an error with a suggestion.
#
# Expected error:
#   [Config Error] Action type "SetStat" was used but is not defined.
#   Did you mean "SetState"?
#
# The error points to line 22 where the invalid action is defined.
