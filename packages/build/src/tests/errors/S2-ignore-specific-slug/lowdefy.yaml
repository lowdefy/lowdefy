# S2: Suppress Specific Check with ~ignoreBuildChecks: ['state-refs']
# ====================================================================
# Tests that ~ignoreBuildChecks with an array suppresses only specified checks.
#
# The block has an undefined _state reference which would normally warn,
# but ~ignoreBuildChecks: ['state-refs'] is set on the block to suppress
# only state reference warnings.
#
# Expected: NO warning should be shown for state-refs.
