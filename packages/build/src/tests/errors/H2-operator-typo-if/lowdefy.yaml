# H2: Operator Typo (_iff)
# =========================
# Tests that unknown operators throw an error with a "Did you mean?" suggestion.
# This example uses "_iff" which is a typo for "_if".
#
# Expected warning:
#   [Config Error] Operator type "_iff" was used but is not defined.
#   Did you mean "_if"?
#
# The error points to line 19 where the operator is used.
