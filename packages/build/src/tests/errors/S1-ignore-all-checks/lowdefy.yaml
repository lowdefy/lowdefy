# S1: Suppress All Checks with ~ignoreBuildChecks: true
# ======================================================
# Tests that ~ignoreBuildChecks: true suppresses all build-time checks.
#
# The block has an undefined _state reference which would normally warn,
# but ~ignoreBuildChecks: true is set on the block.
#
# Expected: NO warning should be shown.
