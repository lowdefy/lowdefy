# S6: Wrong Slug Does Not Suppress
# =================================
# Tests that specifying the wrong check slug does not suppress warnings.
#
# The block has ~ignoreBuildChecks: ['types'] but the warning is for
# a state-refs issue. The warning should still appear.
#
# Expected: Warning for undefinedKey should still appear.
