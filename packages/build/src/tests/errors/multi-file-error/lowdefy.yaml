# Multi-file Error Tracking
# ==========================
# Tests that errors in _ref imported files show the correct source file path.
#
# Before the fix (issue #1947), errors in child files showed the parent file path
# with child file line numbers (wrong file, correct line). Now errors correctly
# show the actual source file path.
#
# Expected error:
#   [Config Error] Block type "NonExistentBlockType" was used but is not defined.
#   pages/home.yaml:13 at root.pages[0:home:Box].blocks[0:invalidBlock:NonExistentBlockType]
#
# The error correctly shows pages/home.yaml, not lowdefy.yaml.
