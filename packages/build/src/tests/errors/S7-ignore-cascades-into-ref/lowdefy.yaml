# S7: ~ignoreBuildChecks Cascades Into _ref
# ==========================================
# Tests that ~ignoreBuildChecks on a _ref propagates into the
# resolved content, suppressing warnings from within the referenced file.
#
# The _ref has ~ignoreBuildChecks: true, and the referenced template
# contains an undefined _state reference. The warning should be suppressed.
#
# Expected: NO warning for the child block's undefined _state reference.
